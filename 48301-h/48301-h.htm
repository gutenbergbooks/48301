<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> the writing of this little book so many
difficulties have arisen that, but for
the repeated requests of a generous
public for further news of the Midshipman
whose earlier adventures are recorded in
"From Dartmouth to the Dardanelles,"
we had been tempted to defer publication
until the advent of that longed-for time
which "Tommy" speaks of as "Good old
<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">après la guerre!</span>"</p>

<p>Naval officers on active service are not
allowed to keep diaries, and this narrative
has been compiled solely from rough notes
of conversations with my son, hurriedly set
down on the rare occasions during the last
two and a half years when we have had
the good fortune to be together. Much of
the material eventually available we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>omitted from motives of discretion. Still
more has been eliminated by drastic but
absolutely necessary censorship. What remains
makes but a slender volume. Nevertheless
I trust it will prove not wholly
uninteresting to all those unknown friends
in England, Australia, India, New Zealand,
and last, but by no means least, the United
States of America, who have taken the
trouble to write me such exceedingly kind
letters in respect of the former book. Let
me here gratefully assure them that their
sympathy and the generous impulse which
prompted its expression has done <em>much</em>
to help me through years naturally heavy-laden
with anxiety and suspense.</p>

<p>Thanks, above all, to my American
correspondents: theirs was a difficult and
delicate position in view of the loyalty they
owed to their country's neutrality; but
while yet certain issues were in doubt
their letters seemed to whisper: "Only
wait—trust us—we shall yet be with you
in deed as we are with you in heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>To-day that prophecy is gloriously fulfilled.
Sacrifice and sacrament are consummated:
the Stars and Stripes are
unfurled in the cause of true liberty, and
Old Glory waves side by side with the
banners of the Allies! Who dares doubt
the end?</p>

<p class="mt2">A word of explanation as to the title of
the book may be desired by readers unacquainted
with naval slang. "Snotty" is
a dreadful word of, I am sure, libellous
origin! But it is pure navalese. "Middy"
is not a Service term at all, and the curly-haired
"Middy" so dear to writers of
fiction and comic opera has no existence
in fact—he is a regular "Mrs. Harris"!</p>

<p>For all their youth, our Snotties are men
in the best sense of the word, and right
loyally do they cling to every tradition—written
or unwritten—of that splendid
Service to which it is their pride and
privilege to belong.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>OF A PICNIC AND A TRAGEDY</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> August 26, 1915, I went up to the
Admiralty for medical survey, was
passed fit for active service, and on
September 1 I received my appointment to
H.M.S. <i>C——</i>, a super-Dreadnought in the
Grand Fleet. Although I knew her to be
a very fine ship, I was nevertheless disappointed,
as I had been hoping to again see
service in a <abbr class="spell">T.B.D.</abbr>—the few weeks I had
spent in one of those craft in the Dardanelles
after my last ship was sunk having convinced
me that the life was far freer and
more exciting than that in a big ship.</p>

<p>However, the Powers had decreed otherwise,
and so on September 2 I left home
and the same night went straight through
from King's Cross to Inverness. Arrived in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>that town I duly reported myself to the
Senior Naval Officer at the Admiralty Office,
and was told to return at 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> the next
morning. I thereupon took the first train
I could catch to Dingwall, and went up to
call upon some friends at Tulloch. I had
the good luck to find them at home, and
they very kindly invited me to stay the night
and so saved me from a dull evening alone
at an hotel. I spent a very cheery time
with Mr. and Mrs. D——, and the next
morning got up at 7 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, had an early
breakfast, and motored down to the station
and caught the 7.35 train back to Inverness.
On my reporting at 9 o'clock to the <abbr title="Senior Naval Officer">S.N.O.</abbr>
he gave me a railway pass to ——, and
told me to proceed thither by the 11.15.
The name of my destination it would not,
at this time, be permissible for me to
mention. Enough that in company with
some other <abbr title="Naval Officer">N.O.</abbr>'s with whom I had travelled
I eventually reached it, and the mail steamer
took us alongside H.M.S. ——, the Fleet
mail ship, where we waited until one by
one my fellow-travellers were taken off by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>various odd craft—varying from drifters
to picket-boats—which conveyed them to
their respective ships. I was the last left
aboard the —— and lunched there—and
a very nasty lunch it was too! At about
2.39 a drifter came alongside to fetch the
mails for the First Battle Squadron, and
having transferred myself and gear to her
she took me to H.M.S. ——, alongside which
ship she remained for a good half-hour
before a picket-boat from my new ship
turned up, called for her mail, and conveyed
me to my final destination.</p>

<p>On my arrival I found coaling just finished
and washing down still in progress. On
my way forward to report to the officer of
the watch I met some Snotties just going
ashore, and among their number I was glad
to recognize several of my old term mates
at Osborne and Dartmouth, with whom
I exchanged greetings. After I had duly
reported myself, the Snotty of the watch
showed me the way down to the gunroom,
where he left me to make the acquaintance
of some half-dozen of my new messmates,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>who, not being on duty, were variously
occupied in "caulking" (a naval slang term
for dozing), reading, writing letters, etc.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The —— boasts a fairly large and roomy
gunroom. Down one side of it is the long
narrow mess-table covered with a red and
black cloth, and on the left centre a stove with
an open fireplace, before which is placed a
settee sacred to the use of the senior members
of the mess, and woe betide the presumptuous
junior who ventures to make use of it without
express permission. True, it is a battered
piece of furniture, having suffered severely
in many a guest-night "rag," and its springs
recall the story of the British matron who,
after seating herself majestically in a Paris
fiacre, jumped up with the agonized cry:
"<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cochon! Cochon! Arrêté! Arrêté! Sortez-moi!
Vos printemps sont cassé!</span>" Nevertheless
it is symbolical of the privileges of
seniority, and as such to be regarded and
treated with respect. Almost equally sacrosanct
are the two deep arm-chairs flanking
the fireplace; the remainder of the furniture</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><i>consists of a motley collection of other chairs,
a sideboard in which the Mids keep their
private stores of jam, potted meat, etc., some
hanging bookcases, and a funny little old
piano. The whole is lighted by three large
scuttles or port-holes.</i></p></div>

<p>Presently, his watch over, the Senior
Midshipman came down again and I went
with him to see the Commander—commonly
known as "The Bloke." After asking me
a few questions about my previous experiences,
he took me to see the Captain, who
received me very kindly and also inquired
about my active service adventures. These
interviews over, I returned to the gunroom,
where I was told the name of my servant,
and how to get hold of him when wanted.
I was given the usual twenty-four hours in
which to "sling my hammock," or, in other
words, settle down to the customary routine,
and I was not expected to enter on my new
duties until the following day. So I sent
for the bandsman who had been told off to
valet me and arranged with him where my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>gear, etc., should be stowed. Tea in the
gunroom followed, after which the Senior
Snotty showed me round the ship.</p>

<p>That night I slept with five others in the
Chief of Staff's cabin, which, not being in
use at the moment, had been allotted to us
as a school place and sleeping apartment.</p>

<p>The next morning dawned calm and misty.
The others went up at 6.45 to turret drill in
accordance with usual routine, but as I was
still "slinging my hammock" I was not
required to turn out until 7, when I repaired
to the bathroom, had a bath, dressed, and
subsequently joined my messmates at
breakfast. I may here admit that I felt
a bit "out of it" at first, as most of the
mess had been working together for the
best part of a year, and the position of a
newly joined Snotty is not unlike that of a
new boy at school. However, I soon settled
down and adapted myself to the rigid
discipline prevailing.</p>

<p>After breakfast we got under way and
steamed over to the northern shore to
carry out some gunnery tests.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>In the afternoon I went ashore with some
of the others and visited the little town of
——, which is the only approach to civilization
of which this wild and remote spot
can boast.</p>

<p>An account of the following weeks'
routine would be of little interest to any
but Service readers, and the majority of
these will be already but too intimately
acquainted with the same. The monotony
was pleasantly broken on the fourteenth,
on which day the Captain gave a picnic to
the gunroom. We all, with the exception
of the Acting Sub-Lieutenant, who had to
keep the afternoon watch, "cleaned" into
picnic rig, which consisted of sea-boots,
flannel trousers, sweaters, and various forms
of weird and unorthodox headgear. ("Cleaning"
is naval phraseology for shifting and
is always used even when the said shift is
into coaling rig.) Having supplied ourselves
with large quantities of cigarettes and
tobacco, as well as pistols and shot-guns,
fishing tackle, etc., we embarked in the
cutter, in which the hampers provided by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>the Captain had already been placed, and
so, at about 1 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, set sail for a point on
the shore previously decided upon. As
soon as we were well clear of the ship, those
who had fishing tackle put out their lines,
while the rest settled down in the bottom
of the boat, and pipes and cigarettes were
soon in full blast. Several mackerel were
caught on the way over, and half an hour
after leaving the ship we grounded. Then
every one jumped out, and we anchored
the cutter in the shallow water by the
shore.</p>

<p>Scattering in various directions we ragged
about until tea-time. Some tried their hand
at tickling trout in a small stream; some
bathed; others set up targets of bottles
and practised shooting. When the time
came to open the hampers it was found that
Captain ——'s hospitality knew no bounds.
They proved to contain sandwiches of every
sort and description, also cakes, sardines,
chocolates, and an unending variety of other
delicacies, as well as some tins of superlatively
good cigarettes such as rarely fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>to the lot of the notoriously impecunious
midshipman.... Such a blow-out was not
conducive to any more active exercise, and
most of us relapsed into the slumber of
repletion.</p>

<p>At 4.30 we began to pack up, and by 5
had collected all our gear into the cutter,
weighed anchor, and set sail for the ship.
More mackerel were caught on the way
back, and we eventually drew alongside
just as the Acting Sub. was setting off in
the picket-boat with confidential papers
for sundry ships in the Fleet.</p>

<p>We gave him a commiserating hail, for
the wind had shifted to an evilly inspired
quarter, and it looked like being rather a
dirty night, and then we went light-heartedly
below to have our baths and
shift into proper uniform.... How little
we dreamed then that the joyous memory
of the Captain's picnic was destined to be
linked for ever in our minds with the saddest
of tragedies.... We never saw poor De B.
again.... While he was away a heavy
sea got up, and when the boat drew alongside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>again he was found to be missing.
All the coxswain could tell was that half-way
through the return trip and when
about a mile and a half from our ship, he
had come up to speak to him for a few
minutes, and then, as he (the coxswain)
supposed, returned to the stern-sheets.
It can only be assumed that a sudden lurch
of the boat caused him to miss his footing
and so fall overboard. Of course in heavy
sea-boots and overcoat he would have little
chance in a roughish sea. It was pitch-dark,
and no cry was heard, and the crew
never even suspected that anything was
wrong until the boat came alongside and
it was found that he had disappeared.</p>

<p>All our searchlights were immediately
switched on, and we made a signal to the
neighbouring cruisers, telling them to switch
on theirs and sweep the sea all around.
All boats were called away, and a minute
search was instituted, but it was of no
avail, and at midnight had to be reluctantly
abandoned as hopeless. Next morning
boats were sent out to sweep for his body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>and search the neighbouring shores; but
no trace was discovered until a week later,
when H.M.S. —— picked up his cap.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The picket-boats, in which so much essential
work is done, have neither stanchions nor rails,
and the space between the top of the cabin
and the side is so narrow that if there is a bit
of a sea on the chance of such an accident as
happened to poor De B. is obvious—though
naturally the Service never gives it a thought—it
is all in the day's or the night's work.
But should these lines ever be read by his
people, let them for their comfort remember
that he died for England as surely as if he
had passed in the crash and roar of battle
... and his shipmates hold him for all time
in honoured and regretful memory....</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>OF A HOSPITAL SHIP AND SICK LEAVE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Three</span> days after that picnic and
its sad ending we weighed and returned
to the winter anchorage. Of
the weeks that followed there is little to
tell, as of the few incidents which broke
the monotony of ordinary routine discretion
forbids mention.</p>

<p>Some time in November we proceeded to
——, which same, although a very one-horse
place in ordinary circumstances, was
a step beyond the more northerly district
in point of civilization. But we had only
been there about two weeks when I was
knocked out by a chill which refused to
yield to ordinary remedies. My previous
winter, spent mainly in tropical climes,
had rather unfitted me for the semi-arctic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>conditions obtaining in the North
Sea.</p>

<p>After a couple of days spent in the
dignified seclusion of a cabin, the Fleet
Surgeon packed me off to the hospital ship
<i>China</i>. This was real jam, for I was not so
ill but that I was able to highly appreciate
the comfort and luxury provided by a
paternal Government for the sick <abbr title="Naval Officer">N.O.</abbr>
Moreover, the Captain of the hospital ship
proved to be an old acquaintance who
had often entertained me and my former
messmates on his ship when she and
the <i>Goliath</i> were lying together at Mombasa
a year before. I was put into the
officers' ward, which was empty at this
time, and the nurses were most awfully
kind and attentive. One does appreciate
feminine ministrations after living for so
long in the exclusive society of the mere
man.</p>

<p>It was with great glee that from my
luxurious idleness I watched the Fleet
depart once more for the northern base,
hugging the knowledge that the medical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>powers had decreed that I was to go south
in a few days' time.</p>

<p>On December 2 I said "good-bye" to the
staff of the <i>China</i> and embarked in a
drifter for the beach. On arrival I walked
to the station and there waited for the
ambulance with the doctor and the other
patients. When they turned up, I strolled
up and down with Dr. —— for about three-quarters
of an hour until the hospital train
came in. This train was magnificently
appointed, with big coaches—rather like
Pullman-cars, fitted up with swinging cots.
The officers' sleeping compartment consisted
of one of these cars divided by a
curtain from the men's half, and containing
about six cots. For some four hours—except
when the two medical officers attached
to the train staff came in to bear me
company—I had this compartment to
myself. When the train stopped at Queensferry
I was joined by a Sub-Lieutenant
<abbr title="Royal Navy">R.N.</abbr> and a Sub. of the <abbr title="Royal Naval Reserve">R.N.R.</abbr>—both
"sitting cases," i.e. not very seriously ill.
As soon as we got under way again, dinner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>was served, and about 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> we all turned
in. Personally I slept very soundly, only
waking up once at some station—York, I
think—where a gunner who was a "stretcher
case" was put aboard.</p>

<p>At eight next morning we arrived in
London, where we stopped for some hours,
and from whence we proceeded to Chatham.
Here a <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Commander—also a "sitting
case"—was added to our party, and at four
o'clock in the afternoon we started back to
London again, and there we once more
spent a long time waiting for—Heaven
knows what! On the following day we
arrived at Devonport, where the <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Commander
left us. By this time the
journey had begun to assume the vague
irresponsibility of a dream, and, as in a
dream, there seemed to be no reason why
it should ever come to an end. We seemed
destined to just go on—and on—and on—wandering
around the various railway
systems of England and Scotland, and
stopping aimlessly for an indefinite period
at whatever spot caught the engine-driver's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>errant fancy! But it really did not matter,
for it was very warm and comfortable in
the train, so—let the dream go on!</p>

<p>However, it ended at Portsmouth at
6.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> on the third day of my journeying.
Portsmouth was my final destination as well
as that of all the other cases in the train.
Large ambulance cars were in waiting, and
these eventually deposited us at Haslar
Hospital about seven o'clock. Here our
first interview was with the matron, then
we proceeded to the doctor on duty for the
day, who took down particulars of our
respective maladies. Dinner in the officers'
mess followed, after which we again saw the
matron, who then told us in which cabins
we were billeted. Mine was situated in
B Block, and a long way from the officers'
mess, and so, as the <abbr title="Royal Naval Reserve">R.N.R.</abbr> Sub. who had
been one of my fellow-travellers was also
located in that block, as soon as I had
settled my gear in my cabin I went along
to his and smoked and chatted with him
for about half an hour before turning in.</p>

<p>Next morning I had my breakfast in bed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>and had to remain there until I had been
visited by the doctor, after which I got up.
By the time I was dressed my spirits had
drooped to a very low ebb. The cabin was
a most comfortless apartment, sparsely
furnished and with its only window giving
on to a gloomy enclosed courtyard where
the rain pattered dismally down from a
leaden square of sky. I felt as though I
was in prison "doing time" for some sordid
and wholly uninteresting crime.</p>

<p>However, about four o'clock came a
joyful surprise in the shape of a telegram
from my mother, saying that she was
coming over to see me and would arrive
next day. On the moment depression
vanished, for I felt certain that she would
devise some means to relieve the tedium of
my confinement. Sure enough, as soon
as she arrived she interviewed the doctor
and soon persuaded him that I was quite
well enough to go home, and after she
had signed the requisite form undertaking
to be responsible for any further medical
treatment I might require, she returned to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Portsmouth, where I joined her on the
following day.</p>

<p>That night, December 8, we crossed over
to our island, and I recollect a rather funny
episode on that journey. Some swollen-headed
Jack-in-office in the passport department
at Southampton said he could not
pass me because I had no document from
the hospital authorities showing that I was
on sick leave. The Lord only knows if the
fool thought I was a deserter, or if he was
merely a confirmed obstructionist making
trouble for the fun of the thing. Anyway
he was sullenly obstinate, entrenched in his
"little brief authority," and declared that
he could not and would not pass me! It
looked like being a pretty muddle, for it was
10 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> and raining cats and dogs. Then
mother came to the rescue with a perfectly
gorgeous piece of "bluff." Declaring that
she had not the smallest intention of remaining
indefinitely at Southampton, or of
going on without me, she calmly requested
him to ring up the <i>Admiralty</i>, when she
would get him orders from headquarters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>He could not have looked more amazed if
she had demanded a trunk call to Heaven.
But she was as firm as if she knew she held
a royal flush to his pair of knaves, and so
he hurriedly climbed down, and said he
would take the responsibility of passing me,
and we proceeded in triumph aboard the
<abbr title="London and South Western Railway">L.S.W.R.</abbr>'s steamer which was lying alongside
the quay, and so reached home the
next morning without further incident.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>I may here remark that I was perfectly
certain that the man was wrong, for if any
such document had been really required, the
hospital authorities would have provided it.
The Navy does not neglect detail.</i></p></div>

<p>I had been granted sick leave to extend
over Christmas, which was a tremendous
stroke of luck, but the time passed all too
quickly, and on January 4, 1916, we went
to London for my medical survey. I was
passed fit on the 5th, and expected to have
to rejoin at once. However, to my intense
surprise and delight, I ran into one of our
Snotties in Bond Street that afternoon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>and he told me that our ship was in dock
and they had all been granted ten days'
leave, so I had that extra time in London,
where we did some theatres and enjoyed
ourselves royally.</p>

<p class="drop-cap mt2"><span class="smcap">It</span> was on January 15, 1916, that I
finally rejoined my ship. She was
then in floating dock at ——. That
night the dock was flooded, and next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>morning we warped out and proceeded to
our billet in the harbour. About a week
later we left ——, and once more the
northern mists closed down upon us.</p>

<p>The deadly monotony of the work of the
Grand Fleet will probably never be fully
realized by any but those whose fate it was
to wait day after day, and week after week,
for the longed-for encounter with the
enemy. Only that ever-present hope carried
us through that dreary second winter of war.
An occasional interval at sea for manœuvres
was the sole relief, and such was our
cussedness that even these were greeted by
most of us with moans and groans, for we
were reduced to a state of irritability and
boredom which only the prospect of "action"
or "leave" could mitigate. Perhaps, however,
to the non-Service reader, an account
of one of these periodical trips may not be
too uninteresting.</p>

<p>After a period of swinging at anchor at
the northern base, we received the customary
signals preparatory to going to sea,
and about 6 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> on the same day we weighed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>and proceeded in the wake of the Second
Battle Squadron. That particular month
I had been detailed for a course of engineering
instruction and consequently did
not have to take any night watches—a
stroke of luck since night watch in mid-winter
in the North Sea is not a job to be
coveted by even the most enthusiastic.
The weather was quite calm and no change
seemed imminent, although it is not really
possible to tell in these latitudes what
conditions may obtain from hour to hour.
As a proof whereof, the next morning
showed a rapidly falling barometer, accompanied
by a rising sea, which increased to
such an extent that it was not possible to
carry out any exercises with the Fleet in
the forenoon. However, we held on our
course in hopes that the weather would
mend, but by lunch-time the sea was running
so high that we were forced to turn for home.
The main deck was already six inches deep
in water, in which floated the usual medley
of debris: the gunroom skylight was leaking
like a sieve; and even the engine-rooms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>and boiler-rooms held their unwelcome
quota of sea water, which poured down the
ventilating shafts.</p>

<p>At one time the Flagship made a signal
for all destroyers to close in on her, and of
course a rumour started—as rumours will—that
she had been mined or torpedoed.
But it was happily a totally false alarm,
and her signal was only a precautionary
measure to enable the <abbr title="Commander in Chief">C.-in-C.</abbr> to keep an
eye on the small craft, which were making
very heavy weather of it indeed. Even
our 20,000-ton Dreadnought was creaking
and groaning under the impact of the waves,
and fenders and life-buoys had broken loose
and were sweeping back and forth across
the decks, and crashing against the turrets
and superstructures.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the middle of the afternoon,
a destroyer sighted a mine and hoisted
Numeral I flag. (It must be understood
that when signals such as these are mentioned,
the numbers given are fictitious, as
for obvious reasons we cannot give the
correct hoists.) Now Numeral I pendant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>denotes a mine in sight, but Numeral I flag
denotes "Flag officers have time for the
next meal." ... Of course the signalman
in his haste had muddled his flags, and had
intended hoisting Numeral I pendant, but
"Flags" (the Flag Lieutenant), seeing in
the incident a momentary chance of lightening
the prevailing boredom and gloom, at
once asked the Admiral's permission to
inquire sarcastically by signal whether the
meal referred to was lunch or tea, and the
destroyer's signalman, in obvious confusion,
hauled down his signal and substituted the
correct hoist. The <abbr title="Commander in Chief">C.-in-C.</abbr> then detailed
the light cruiser —— to go and sink the
mine. It being now some distance astern,
she turned 16 points to starboard and
steamed towards it. We all watched for
the explosion, and as time went on wondered
why she had not opened fire. She seemed
to be circling round it; but the mystery
was explained when her searchlights flashed
out the message: "Supposed mine is a
Reindeer buoy." She was then ordered to
resume station.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>Trivial enough, I admit! But oh, you
readers who imagine the sailor's life in war-time
as one continuous round of blood-curdling
excitement, try to realize something
of its almost unmitigated dullness—a dullness
so overwhelming that even such an
incident as the above is welcomed as a
slight relief.</p>

<p>In the evening the violence of the storm
abated, and when I woke the next morning
there was scarcely any motion on the ship
at all. When I went up on deck I found
that there was a thick haze on the water
which almost hid the ships on either side of
us. By ten o'clock this fog had so increased
in density that it completely blotted out
our next ahead, and, to his great disgust,
the Snotty of the watch was ordered forward
to the fo'c'sle head to keep lookout. The
fog continued to thicken until the bridge
was scarcely visible from the eyes of the
ship. (The eyes of the ship means right
forward in the bow.) On all sides the
sirens kept up a dismal wail of warning.
Presently the Snotty of the watch noticed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>that we were passing along the bubbling
wake of another ship which must have been
perilously close, and shortly afterwards the
stern of a destroyer loomed ahead and
scarcely a hundred yards away. Through
his megaphone the lookout reported:
"Destroyer right ahead." We instantly
slowed down and at the same moment the
<abbr class="spell">T.B.D.</abbr>, seeing her danger, put her helm
hard over and rapidly drew away into the
mist to starboard.</p>

<p>The fog did not clear away until the
afternoon, but we anchored at our base
late that evening, and coaling was soon
in progress.</p>

<p>Of all the dangers and inconveniences
with which sailors have to contend, fog is
perhaps the most trying and exasperating.
I remember an occasion when Campbell and
I were bidden to dine in H.M.S. ——, and
as "Torps" happened also to be dining out,
though in another ship, we managed to get
a steamboat to convey us to our respective
destinations, but "The Bloke" could not
give us one to bring us back. We therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>arranged with various other Snotties that
a gunroom whaler's crew should come and
pick us all up about 9.30. As we were the
junior officers they called first at the ship
where we had been dining, and came
inboard for a few minutes for a drink and a
cigarette. We eventually shoved off about
9.40, arriving alongside the ship which was
entertaining "Torps" some five minutes
later. As he was not quite ready we went
inboard for more drinks and smokes. When
we finally embarked for our own ship we
found that a thick fog had come down.
The inference that will here be drawn by the
evil-minded, if logical, is incorrect! The
fog in question was <em>not</em> in our heads, but
very much upon the water! In a very few
seconds H.M.S. —— had vanished from
our sight and we found ourselves shut in by
a dense white wall, with nothing but the
fog-bells to guide us. After pulling hard
for what seemed like a considerable time
we sighted a ship dimly outlined upon our
starboard bow, but she proved to be not, as
we had fondly expected, our happy home,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>but the hospitable vessel we had left ten
minutes before. So we turned our boat
round, carefully took our bearings, and set
out anew. After another quarter of an hour
or so we sighted H.M.S. ——, but she was
not our objective either; and so the game
of blind man's buff went on until there
really seemed no reason to suppose that we
should ever succeed in finding our own ship.
Finally, however, by dint of strenuous
effort, sheer pertinacity, and a blind clutching
to the skirts of happy chance, we made her
at last, after more than an hour of heavy
pulling.</p>

<p>"Torps," in common gratitude, invited
the weary crew into the wardroom and
administered refreshment in various forms,
after which we repaired to our own quarters
and thankfully turned in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>NAVAL THEATRICALS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">His</span> Majesty's ship ——, suddenly
seized with the hospitable desire to
entertain her sister ships, decided
forthwith on theatricals. Nothing so banal as
any already familiar piece by a "pukka"
playwright was contemplated.... A combination
of fertile naval brains produced the
book of the words crammed with topical
and cryptic allusions; the music was
borrowed from the latest comic operas and
revues, and the actors were recruited mainly
from the ranks of junior officers. Then in
due course the following signal appeared in
our gunroom: "Captain and Officers of
H.M.S. —— request the pleasure of the
company of Flag Officers, Captains, and
Officers of the 4th <abbr title="Battle Squadron">B.S.</abbr> at their Theatricals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>on board <i>Gourko</i> at 2000 (8 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>) to-night.
Boats to be alongside at 2130 (11.30)."</p>

<p><i>Gourko</i> was the ship in which all such
entertainments were held, and the above
was the usual form of invitation issued to
the Grand Fleet.</p>

<p>Accordingly at 7.45 that evening two
"G's" sounded, indicating that our boat was
ready alongside to take such of us as were
off duty to the show in question. About a
dozen were able to avail themselves of the
invite. The night was cloudy and a stiff
breeze was blowing when we embarked.
It was not at all the sort of evening when
dwellers on the "beach" would be tempted
to set out in open picket-boats to witness
an amateur theatrical performance, but
from long experience the Navy is inured to
climatic conditions which would prove
decidedly damping to the enthusiasm of
their brethren ashore. As Hamlet says:
"The play's the thing"—and Gott strafe
the weather!</p>

<p>In about five minutes we drew alongside
the gangway of H.M.S. ——, and having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>boarded her with due ceremony we were
escorted down to her gunroom and there
hospitably entertained with cigarettes and
liquid refreshment until the time appointed
for the fun to commence. Then we were
piloted across to the <i>Gourko</i>, which was lying
alongside. The forward hold of this ship
serves as a theatre for the Fleet. A stage
is erected at its after end, immediately in
front of which are placed the arm-chairs
sacred to Flag Officers and Captains. On
the left is a small dais occupied by the
band, and behind the arm-chairs are several
tiers of very hard benches on which the
less exalted ranks are accommodated.</p>

<p>When we arrived, the auditorium was
already more than half filled with <abbr title="Naval Officer">N.O.</abbr>'s
of varied ranks, and the atmosphere was
thick with tobacco smoke. The band was
playing selections from a well-known revue,
and a confused buzz and drone of conversation
greeted our entrance.</p>

<p>As soon as the Admirals and four-stripers
(Captains) had taken their seats, the band
stopped playing and the curtain went up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>revealing the stage occupied by an agitated
Lieutenant (he was a Midshipman in real
life) pacing up and down what apparently
represented the smoking-room of a very
second-rate hotel, and anathematizing the
exploits of a German spy, who, it would seem,
laboured under the appalling cognomen of
Stinkenstein!</p>

<p>Presently the Lieutenant was joined by
his sweetheart—a lady designed to be
beautiful—but the illusion was somewhat
marred by the deep bass voice and blue
shaven chin of the Snotty who had been
cast for the part—presumably with more
regard for his histrionic ability than for his
physical fitness. In the best traditional
stage manner the distracted lover confides
his troubles to the sympathetic ear of the
beauteous (?) maiden, with the additional
information that he must shortly leave her
and vanish once more behind the northern
mists. Thereupon she informs him of her
fixed determination to follow him, if needs
be to the world's end—and in the meantime
to obtain a position as <abbr class="spell">V.A.D.</abbr> in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>officers' tea pavilion situated on one of the
islands at the northern base! He greets
this heroic resolve with a singular lack of
enthusiasm, but the lady is not to be turned
from her purpose, so they proceed to sing
a highly sentimental duet, after which they
leave the stage with arms lovingly intertwined.</p>

<p>Enter from the wings a smartly dressed
marine, who informs the audience that he is
on ten days' leave—and then from the left
centre advances a lady's maid. They, too,
prove to be lovers and promptly fall into
each other's embrace. More sentimental
business follows, until they are driven from
the stage by a number of sandwichmen,
who sing an amusing part-song about
"Jenks's Vegetable Compound." Enter
their foreman, who bustles them off to work,
and the marine and lady's maid reappear
and resume their amatory intercourse.
They are soon again disturbed, this time by
the Lieutenant's fiancée, who is also the
lady's maid's mistress. Covered with confusion,
the marine endeavours to hide under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>a quite inadequate arm-chair, while the maid
mendaciously explains that he is merely a
man come to hang pictures. Seizing this
clue, he proceeds to remove all the pictures
from the walls with much zeal and clatter,
and then exit.</p>

<p>Now the lady confides to her maid her
plan for keeping in touch with her lover,
and invites her co-operation. The maid
jumps at the idea, for is not the marine—by
happy chance—in charge of those same
ridiculous and preposterous tea-rooms! And
the curtain falls on the first act.</p>

<p>After a short interval the stage is once
more revealed, and now shows the aforesaid
island at dawn. The tea-house is on the
left, and in the foreground a group of pirates
of the good old-fashioned melodramatic kind
are lying noisily asleep. Their sentry goes
around waking them by vigorous kicks.
Then they breakfast on rum, and a heated
argument takes place over the question of
calling their formidable Chief. He, it appears,
is afflicted in the morning hours
with a shortness of temper highly dangerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>to the health of any one to whose lot it falls
to arouse him. Eventually one of them
undertakes the job, and, having carefully
removed a gigantic knobkerrie to a safe
distance from his Chief's side, deals him a
resounding smack on the most prominent
part of his person. The pirate springs to
his feet with a volley of strange oaths,
kicks every one within reach, and shouts
for his breakfast of rum. Refreshed and
soothed thereby he calls for his Chief of
Staff, Cuthbert Cut-throat, a lanky, pasty-faced
villain, and together they go through
a list of booty captured that month. This
comprises many weird items, and its recital
invokes roars of laughter from the audience.
Then the pirate calls for his children, and
there enter from the wings a Marine Lieutenant
fearfully and wonderfully arrayed in
a short, light blue pinafore, revealing bare
and unmistakably masculine legs. This
vision wears a tow-coloured wig and has its
face heavily painted in imitation of a cheap
doll. It is followed by an exceedingly small
boy in a sailor suit, and also with bare legs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>and we are given to understand that this
is "her" twin brother. The Pirate Chief
greets them with loud smacking kisses,
but soon becoming bored with his prodigious
offspring, he once more summons Cuthbert
Cut-throat, and to him discourses in maudlin
sentimentality of the virtues and graces of
his last wife, whom he apparently murdered
about a month before! Life without a
wife he declares to be impossible, and announces
his intention of filling the vacancy
with the first likely looking "little bit of
skirt" he comes across. Then the pirates
strike camp, and disappear into a cave on
the right of the stage. (No explanation
forthcoming!)</p>

<p>(Isn't it silly! But it amuses us vastly
all the same!)</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Act III.</span> <i>Same Scene</i></p>

<p>Two naval Captains (Midshipmen in real
life) are discovered seated at a table in
front of the tea-house. From their conversation
we gather that four important
personages have arrived on a visit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>inspection to the Fleet. They are the
Rev. Reuben Reubenstein, and three
Eastern Potentates—namely, the Jam of
Butteria, the Nabob of Nowhere, and the
Maharajah of Marmaladia!</p>

<p>Now enter two golf maniacs, in one of
whom we recognize the Lieutenant of the
first act. After the maddening manner of
their kind they proceed to play their game
over again, stroke for stroke, in conversation,
to the infinite disgust and boredom of
the naval Captains. Presently they shout
for tea, and are served, to the utter dismay
of her lover, by the beauteous fiancée. On
recognizing her he completely loses his head,
upsets the tea-table, reproaches her in
agitated whispers, refers to the Captains as
"silly old fools," and commits various other
stage indiscretions. She wisely retires—and
he continues to walk around soliloquizing,
and apparently appealing to the audience
for help and advice in the awkward predicament
in which the too ardent lady has
placed him! Finally he goes out, after
having several times saluted the Captains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>first with one hand and then with the
other.</p>

<p>Enter the Eminent Divine—a lanky,
meek-looking person in spectacles. He is
closely followed by the Eastern Potentates
in flowing white robes. One of them wears
a head-dress of bastard Turkish design;
another has his face blackened and surmounted
by a pointed black hat, rather like
a witch's; and the third is crowned by a
Parisian (?) confection profusely adorned
with feathers. They greet the Captains
with weird salutations, presumably Oriental
in origin, and jabber to them in unintelligible
tongues, and finally with them retire,
apparently in complete agreement.</p>

<p>The stage is left to the Rev. Reuben
Reubenstein, whose soliloquy soon reveals
him as the Spy Stinkenstein. After indulging
in a "Gott strafe" against England
he yodels "Life in the Alps," and dances
a breakdown in fine style, finally in his
frenzy smashing his umbrella and both the
tea-tables! Curtain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Act IV.</span> <i>Same Scene</i></p>

<p>Evening: the lady is discovered sitting
outside the tea-house with her maid. After
a few moments of desultory conversation
the maid is dismissed, and the lady awaits
her lover.</p>

<p>Enter Stinkenstein, singing. The lady
does not take the trouble to look round,
but assumes—quite unwarrantably and
regardless of grammar—"That's <em>him</em>."
Stinkenstein comes up behind her, puts his
arms round her neck, and is about to
embrace her, when she discovers her mistake,
and proceeds to tell him in nervous English
exactly what she thinks of him.</p>

<p>Pirates emerge from the cave and surround
them. The maid rushes out to
rescue her mistress and is also captured.
The pirates drag them into the cave. Enter
the Lieutenant with a landing party to
capture the pirates. He finds his fiancée's
handkerchief on the ground, and asks
Ordinary Seaman Gorblimey, in charge of
landing party, if he has a detective among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>his men. A Hostility <abbr class="spell">O.D.</abbr> with a huge
black moustache steps forward, lights an
enormous pipe, and demands an overcoat
and a bowler hat. Producing a gigantic
magnifying-glass he detects stains of rum
on the ground and deduces—<em>pirates</em>! The
landing party then storms the cave with
drawn cutlasses, and a fierce fight ensues, in
which, of course, the sailors are triumphant
and the pirates are captured. The sweethearts
are reunited, and the Lieutenant
recognizes Reubenstein as Stinkenstein the
spy. The pirates are then liberated on the
score of having been instrumental in the
capture of Stinkenstein, and the leaders are
decorated by the <abbr title="Commander in Chief">C.-in-C.</abbr>! Grand finale to
the tune of "The Bing Boys are here."
Prolonged applause. Curtain.</p>

<p>The audience stands to "Attention" as
the band plays "God Save the King"—and
the show is over.</p>


<p class="mt2">Then we all return to H.M.S. ——,
where in wardroom and gunroom refreshments
are provided. By this time it has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>turned out a very dirty night, a nasty sea
is running, and it is too rough for picket-boats.
Presently the stentorian voice of
the quartermaster is heard in the officers'
messes: "Fourth Battle Squadron's drifter
alongside." And out of the warmth and
light we all troop to the dark and cold
upper deck, and make our way over to the
theatre ship. Several drifters are alongside,
and these are groaning and creaking under
the impact of heavy seas. Icy spray is
flying before the wind, and there is only a
rope ladder to descend by. Time after time
our drifter parts her securing lines and is
blown away from the ship's side, or crashes
into another astern. At last every one is
safely aboard, but there is no shelter from
the wind and spray, and ours is the last
ship to be called at. Wet and shivering,
we curse the weather, and question ruefully
if it was really worth while to have gone to
the show at all. But at last the drifter
draws alongside and we hastily scramble up
the rope ladder and make a bolt for the
gunroom. A raid on the pantry results in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>a tin of mixed biscuits, for which we all
scramble, and then, very thankfully, turn in.</p>

<p>Well, there you are! How would <em>you</em>
like to go out to an amateur theatrical
performance in an open picket-boat in wind
and rain, and return in a drifter through
raging seas in a full gale? What a life!
Never mind! There's a good time coming,
and as A. M. M. says in <cite>Punch</cite>:</p>

<p class="drop-cap mt2"><span class="smcap">On</span> Tuesday, May 30, 1916, we were at
our northern base lying quietly at
anchor, when in the course of the
afternoon a signal was received from the
Flagship ordering steam. From this we
presumed that we should shortly depart for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>one of our periodical trips to sea for the
purpose of executing manœuvres.</p>

<p>An hour or so later some of the light
cruisers got under way, and on our ship
the bugle-call "Special Duty Men" was
sounded off. The first part of the watch
on deck went on to the fo'c'sle to shorten
in to three shackles: that means to heave
in the port or starboard cable, as the case
may be, to three shackles, preparatory to
weighing anchor.</p>

<p>The Second Battle Squadron having got
under way, we weighed and proceeded to sea
in their wake. It was a calm evening: my
first watch (8 to 12 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>) was uneventful,
and when it was over I turned in. Next
morning I had my bath at 6.45, and when
dressed repaired to the gunroom in the hope
that my seven-bell (naval phraseology for
7.30) breakfast, which I had ordered overnight,
would be ready for me.... Vain
hope triumphing over experience, and
doomed to disappointment. As usual the
said breakfast did not materialize until five
minutes to eight, which left me exactly two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>minutes in which to consume it ... very
bad for digestion and temper!</p>

<p>That hurried meal over, I went up to the
bridge to relieve the officer in charge of
submarine lookouts for the morning watch.
It was a glorious day, with a foretaste of
summer in the air. The sea was calm, and
visibility rather below normal. The Fleet
was proceeding leisurely in usual formation.
In accordance with custom, at 9.15 "General
Quarters" was sounded off by the bugler,
and the succeeding two and a half hours at
control stations passed without incident.
This over, the Commander (N.), i.e. navigator,
sent down a chit to the Senior Midshipman,
which chit read as follows: "I consider
this a good opportunity for all Midshipmen
to take sights." This, of course, raised a
moan, but collecting our sextants we paired
off and went up to the signal deck. On
this occasion I was paired with Campbell.</p>

<p>"After you with the deck watch," I said
to the Snotty who was using it. He handed
it over to me a minute later, and my partner
and I compared it with my watch, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>took up a good position for taking a sight.
I levelled my sextant at the sun. "Got
it?" queried Campbell. "No, blast the
beastly thing. Why on earth do they
provide us with upside down telescopes.
I can't get it—half a mo' though, there
it is."</p>

<p>I moved the arm of the instrument along
the arc to bring the sun down to the horizon—in
doing so, lost old Sol again about three
times, but eventually got it down, and then
the horizon was promptly obliterated by
smoke from our funnels. No sooner had
that cleared off than the ship altered course
to starboard, so the elusive orb once more
disappeared, this time obscured by the
funnel, and we had to change to the other
side of the deck and start all over again.
At last I managed to get my reading, and
after my partner had got his, we went off
to the gunroom to have lunch. That meal
disposed of, we set to and worked out our
sights. Mine proved to be miles out, so
after reworking it three times, I came to
the conclusion that there must be something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>wrong with my sextant. I took it down
from the shelf, and going to the scuttle,
proceeded to check all the usual errors.
The index adjustment was all right, but
there were about three degrees of side error
in the instrument. I tried to take it out,
but only succeeded in putting in about
double the amount of index error. After
spending a considerable amount of time in
fiddling about, I shouted for help from any
one who felt capable of giving it. Campbell
promptly volunteered, and we went up on
deck, where we began to try and adjust
the sextant. We had only been up there
a few minutes when I saw a two-flag signal
flutter to the yard-arm of the Flagship.</p>

<p>"<em>Hallo</em>," I cried, "there's an <em>action</em>
signal from the Flag," and picking up one
of the telescopes belonging to the sextant
I tried to make out the hoist. It was—well,
let us call it "X Y" since it would not be
permissible to give the real letters—and it
indicated "Raise steam for full speed with
the utmost dispatch."</p>

<p>We wondered considerably what so unlooked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>for a signal might portend, and after
waiting a few minutes to see if anything
more was coming through, we went down
to the gunroom to give the news to the
others.</p>

<p>The more energetic spirits at once dashed
up on deck to see if anything further had
transpired, and shortly afterwards returned
with the thrilling information that the
signal "B N" had been hoisted.</p>

<p>Here was news indeed, for that signal
meant that action with the enemy was
imminent, and this was the first time during
the war that the Grand Fleet (as distinct
from the Battle Cruiser Fleet) had hoisted it.</p>

<p>There was, however, no time for discussion
just then, as "Control Parties" was immediately
sounded off, and we all hurried to
our appointed "action" stations.</p>

<p>I was stationed in the conning-tower
with a Lieutenant and two other Mids, and
here also were the chief quartermaster, who
manipulates the wheel in action, a telegraph
operator, and one or two other seaman
ratings. Presently a signalman came down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>and showed us a signal which read:
"Commodore T. [the Commodore in command
of all unattached torpedo craft] in
the light cruiser —— reports in touch with
the enemy light forces."</p>

<p>This naturally caused some excitement,
but, in our long months of monotonous
watching and waiting, hope had been so
often deferred that we had grown sceptical
of ever having the good fortune to really
engage the enemy. By this time the whole
Fleet was proceeding at 18 knots, great
clouds of smoke pouring from all funnels.
This smoke, however, ceased as soon as the
fires had been made up sufficiently to give
the necessary head of steam, and as in our
modern battleships with their marvellous
turbine engines vibration is practically
non-existent, only the swift rush of the wind
through the slits in the conning-tower
enabled us to realize the speed the Fleet
had now attained.</p>

<p>About twenty minutes later (3.45 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>)
a signal came from the Vice-Admiral commanding
the battle cruisers, stating that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>was in action with the enemy Battle-Cruiser
Fleet. This was shortly followed
by another which said that he was now
engaging the enemy High Sea Fleet in
latitude ——, longitude ——. The position
indicated was barely fifty miles on our
starboard bow. On receipt we further
increased speed, holding on our original
course, as the engaging ships were proceeding
in a north-westerly direction. All this
being eminently satisfactory, we then went
to tea.</p>

<p>That is to say, half of our number went,
the rest remaining at their posts until the
first batch had finished. The foretop and
conning-tower's crews being told off to
relieve each other for meals, and the senior
officer "Guns" being in the foretop, they
went first, and as usual took more than
their fair share of the allotted time. When
they had at last satisfied their voracious
appetites and our turn came, we found
nearly all peace lights out between deck
and in the gunroom mess. During tea
much speculation was rife, but we dared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>hardly hope even now that we should
indeed get into touch with the enemy.</p>

<p>We stayed below as long as we possibly
could, and eventually returned to our
"action" stations about five o'clock.</p>

<p>Encountering the Yeoman of Signals just
outside the conning-tower, I asked for the
latest news, but nothing fresh had been
received.</p>

<p>Half an hour later we sighted a sailing
ship right ahead. She seemed to draw near
with uncanny speed, and when we were
able to make out her colours she proved to
be Norwegian. It was when she was nearly
abreast of us that we first heard the dull
far-away boom of guns. The sound rapidly
increased in volume and intensity, but as
yet nothing could be seen of the action
taking place just beyond the horizon, and
the sailing ship gliding quietly along, her
canvas, spread to the summer breeze, and
the wide expanse of still blue water together
formed a picture so emblematic of all the
peaceful, everyday things of seafaring life
that it seemed almost impossible to realize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>that within so short a time we should be in
the thick of the greatest naval battle the
world had ever known.</p>

<p>But scarcely had the Norwegian passed
astern when the yellowish haze on our
starboard bow was broken by lurid red
flashes, while here and there the sun glinted
momentarily on the pale grey hulls of the
battle cruisers which loomed up like great
ghosts in the midst of the cordite smoke.</p>

<p>Now our light cruisers and destroyers
dashed ahead belching forth clouds of
black smoke, the water churning and
foaming in their wake. The battle cruisers,
by this time a bare half-mile away, the bow
waves raised by their swift passage creaming
to their fo'c'sles, were firing rapidly with
all guns. From the deck of their Flagship,
just abreast her foremost turrets, a thin
wisp of blue smoke and little flickers of
greenish flame showed where an enemy shell
had found its mark. Under her 'midship
funnel a gaping rent was torn in her side,
revealing a mass of twisted metal where
another projectile had burst. One gun of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>her 'midship turret, thrown out of action,
drooped towards the deck licked by hungry
tongues of flame—but her remaining armament
was still firing doggedly.</p>

<p>Away to starboard the enemy's guns
flashed continuously through the battle
haze. Our light craft swung 8 points to
port, heeling right over under pressure of the
helm. Close beside us a small cruiser of the
—— class lay hove to and awaiting a chance
to dash through the lines. She was so close
that we could see her crew standing laughing
and joking round their guns—plainly
exulting in the longed-for chance of action.</p>

<p>A moment later the enemy opened on our
destroyers, their shells flinging columns of
white spray high in the air—but, as yet,
our ships held their fire.</p>

<p>Now the Flagship hoisted the signal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<em>Remember the glorious First of June
and avenge Belgium.</em>"</p></div>

<p>This was passed down to all quarters
with the added message from our Captain:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<em>Keep calm. Remember the traditions of
the British Navy.</em>"</p></div>

<p>Now our Admiral and his staff came down
to the conning-tower. First came the Flag
Lieutenant, followed shortly by the Admiral's
legs. But here, I regret to say, a
slight hitch occurred, for his "lammy" coat
so hampered his usual agile movements
that the remainder of his person stuck fast
in the manhole, and he was left incontinently
suspended in mid-air. From above the
Captain pushed vigorously at his shoulders,
while "Flags" hauled at his august lower
limbs. It was a comic interlude, but the
combined efforts of his subordinates finally
prevailed, and a few seconds later he stood
safely on the deck.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes the Captain found
that the conning-tower did not give him a
sufficiently comprehensive view of the proceedings,
and, disdaining this place of
comparative safety, dashed away to the
bridge, in which exposed position he remained
for the greater part of the action.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p>Now the air filled with the drone and
shriek of shells of every size which began to
burst round us. One huge projectile—a
ricochet—went lolloping over our fo'c'sle
head, its yellow colour and the dark bands
on its body being plainly visible.</p>

<p>The blast from our first salvo swept the
Admiral's cap from his head, and confusion
reigned in the crowded area of the tower
while "Flags" pursued the errant headgear,
finally retrieving it, and handing it back
politely to his Chief, who rammed it
resentfully down over his eyes. But at the
next salvo it again flew off, this time
disappearing through a slit in the conning-tower
and landing on the deck outside,
where it remained till the end of the action.
"Flags," who seemed to feel in some
obscure way responsible for its vagaries
being thereby reduced to absolute frenzy!</p>

<p>Another of the enemy's funnels went
overboard ere the mist closed down and
hid her. But we had the satisfaction of
seeing that she was stopped, and on fire
fore and aft.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>Some time later, there being no more
enemy craft in sight, I left my instrument
and went to one of the slits in the conning-tower
to see what there was to be seen.</p>

<p>Close on our starboard beam the British
destroyer —— could be seen with a jagged
shell-hole in her starboard quarter, another
on her port bow, and one of her 4-inch
guns dismounted and lying on the deck
with dead and wounded all around. A
portion of her crew was busy getting out
the collision-mats, but paused in their work
to give us a cheer as we forged past. Her
gunner (T.), who had only been transferred
to her from our ship a week before, waved
and shouted greetings to us from her
quarter-deck. Away on our port beam
could be seen the stern and bow of a big
ship which had been split clean in half.
A destroyer was lying off ready to rescue
survivors, but only three figures were
visible standing on the stern of the wreck
just by the huge propellers.</p>

<p>About this time I recollect that the
<abbr title="Commander in Chief">C.-in-C.</abbr> made the signal to turn two points
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>towards the enemy together. By now the
whole of our main armament was firing at
the Hun destroyers, and they, finding it a
good deal too hot for them, turned away.
One had already been blown up, and as
I watched another was sunk by our fire.</p>

<p>H.M.S. ——, having got somewhat out of
station, was firing across our fo'c'sle, which
made things very unpleasant in the conning-tower,
as we got the full benefit of the blast
from each of her salvos. One of her shells
severed our forestay and it fell on the head
of the Snotty on the forebridge, causing him
to express himself in sanguinary terms, but
not really injuring him at all.</p>

<p>At this juncture there came a yell from
"Torps": "<em>Look.</em> There's a d——d great
Hun Dreadnought over there!" And, sure
enough, there emerged through the fog
the bow of a huge ship not more than
8000 yards away.</p>

<p>Hurriedly we got the main armament
trained on her, and instantly opened fire.
She had already opened on us. Through
the glasses of my instrument I could plainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>see every detail of the German's hull and
superstructure—she was of the <i>Derflinger</i>
class. Our first salvo was "over," and no
sooner had it fallen than I saw the right
gun of every one of her turrets fire simultaneously.
There was an anxious moment
as we waited for the fall of the shells. In
about twenty seconds came a roar and a
crash of rending steel, accompanied by a
vivid green flash. For a moment the heat
in the conning-tower was intense, and it
filled with the stifling fumes of the high
explosive. On our gun deck a fierce fire
flared up, followed by a cry for stretcher
parties and water for the wounded, and the
Torpedo Lieutenant was dispatched to
endeavour to extinguish the blaze. Two
of the enemy shells had hit us, but one did
no harm bar taking the sounding platform
overboard.</p>

<p>Our next salvo hit—and gaping rents
appeared in the Hun's sides. However,
this apparently did not seriously affect her
fighting efficiency, as she instantly fired at
us again, but now, happily, her range was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>out and the shells pitched short, bursting
on the water and enveloping the fore part
of our ship in a cloud of spray.</p>

<p>A few minutes later "Torps" returned,
having with the aid of the guns' crews
successfully dealt with the fire, and he
reported to the Captain that all danger
from that cause was now over.</p>

<p>By this time we had twice fired again
and secured several more hits on the enemy
and a dull red glow appeared in the holes
in her sides, showing that fire was getting
a hold on her vitals. Great clouds of
smoke and long tongues of flame shot up
from her quarter-deck. Most of her guns
appeared to be out of action, but a few
still fired spasmodically.</p>

<p>Now some German destroyers hurried up
and made a smoke-screen between us and
our prey as she turned eight points to port,
and listing heavily fled into the mist....
But we knew she was done for.</p>

<p>The visibility on our bow had now
slightly increased, and we could see the
whole of the High Sea Fleet steaming on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>course parallel to our own and firing at our
battle line. We at once got the guns
trained on their leaders and gave them a
few salvos, but they were too far away
for our shooting to be effective. The sun
was already sinking below the horizon, and,
whereas we were silhouetted against the
western sky, the enemy were fast disappearing
in the gathering twilight, and
in another five minutes they were entirely
lost to view.... It is maddening to think
of what we might have achieved had Fate
but granted us another hour of daylight.
As it was, our part in the battle here ended.</p>


<p class="mt2">Periodical bursts of firing were still
audible from ahead, where our battle
cruisers were harrying the rear of the fast
retreating enemy.</p>

<p>We remained at our action stations for
another half-hour, and then "Hands to
Night Defence" was sounded off. After
packing up in the conning-tower we all
rushed off to see what damage the ship
had sustained.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>After my look round I went to the gunroom
and managed to get a glass of very
flat beer, a hunk of bread, and a piece of
pressed beef. This was the only food I had
between tea and breakfast the next morning.
Then I went up on to the bridge, and had
not been there long when the lights of some
strange ship were sighted on our port bow.
The 4-in. guns' crews immediately closed up,
but as we drew nearer the suspect proved
to be nothing but an inoffensive trawler.</p>

<p>This incident over, I went aft to my
night defence station—a little platform
screened by canvas, barely six feet square,
and a good fifty feet above the water-line.
It is commonly known as the "Eiffel Tower,"
and in this small space a party of eight had
to spend the night. Obviously there was no
room to lie down, and, further, it was
bitterly cold.</p>

<p>All night the Hun destroyers tried to
press home an attack on the Battle Fleet,
but our light craft continually beat them off,
sinking many in the process. At intervals
the whole sky was lighted up with a lurid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>glare as one or other of the enemy ships
flared skyward and crashed to her doom.
All around the eastern horizon the flash of
guns was distinctly visible, only dying away
in one quarter to blaze up in another. Had
I been less busy—or less cold—I might
have thought of Tennyson's lines in "The
Revenge":</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

      <div class="verse">Ship after ship the whole night long</div>
      <div class="verse">With her battle-thunder and flame,</div>
      <div class="verse">Ship after ship the whole night long</div>
      <div class="verse">Drew back with her dead and her shame.</div>
      <div class="verse">For some were sunk and many were crippled</div>
      <div class="verse">And so could fight us no more.</div>
      <div class="verse">God of Battles! was ever a battle like this in the world before?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>But, as a matter of fact, nothing was farther
from my mind than poetry.</p>

<p>The sounding off of "General Quarters"
at 2.30 came with a mighty relief, as this
meant that we could return to our more
comfortable "action stations," and our
spell at "night defence" was over.</p>

<p>About 4 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> we sighted a Zeppelin,
which passed over astern of us. Those
ships within range opened fire on her, but at
every flash from the salvos she dipped,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>dropping about 200 feet, and thus avoided
the shells. For a long time she was visible—a
dark body against the eastern sky—but
she finally disappeared in the direction
of Heligoland just as the sun was rising.</p>

<p>At six o'clock next morning, Friday,
June 2, we entered harbour and dropped
anchor without further incident.</p>

<p>Coaling started immediately, and as soon
as the collier had shoved off we were invaded
by dockyard "mateys," and the cracked
boat booms were shored up. We had
hoped that the necessary repairs would
take long enough to ensure our getting some
leave, but in this we were disappointed, for
the damage we had sustained in the battle
was not considered sufficiently serious to
necessitate docking. As we were the only
ship in the Grand Fleet that had been hit,
we were naturally an object of great interest,
and very proud of ourselves in consequence.
We really had marvellous luck, for although
about seven of the ship's company were
wounded—one poor chap having his arm
shattered—we did not lose a man.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<p>So here ends my personal experience of
the famous Battle of Jutland. It will be
readily understood that it is only a fraction
of the whole. As is now well known the
Fifth Battle Squadron and the Battle-Cruiser
Fleet did their job so efficiently
that the Germans fled to their base—thus
robbing the Grand Fleet of the chance to
win a decisive victory.</p>

<p>The Huns, with that genius for mendacity
which they have exhibited throughout the
war, claimed to have defeated the British
Navy—a claim based presumably on the
idea that "he who fights and runs away
will live to fight another day." Subsequent
events must have convinced even their own
people of the fallacy of that claim, and
there remains the proven fact that with
their whole forces in action they refused to
face more than a quarter of our Fleet.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2 mt2"><i><span class="smcap">Those</span> whose men took part in the
Battle of Jutland may forgive—I think
they can never forget—the way in
which England received the first tidings of
that heroic fight. It is the custom in many
quarters to blame the Admiralty for the
wording of their first published report; but,
as my son wrote to me: "They only said
that there had been an engagement, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>we had lost certain ships. Why should
people jump to the conclusion that the
enemy's losses were less than ours?"</i></p>

<p><i><em class="upright">Why</em> indeed! It showed, not only a
complete lack of imagination, but a singular
want of faith in the efficiency of the Navy,
in which they had always proclaimed such
unbounded confidence. It would appear that
the great majority of the British public had not
the faintest conception of the magnitude of the
sacrifices involved in a naval battle fought
under conditions of modern warfare. Were
the people so dazzled and blinded by the
century-old memory of Trafalgar as to forget
the fact that at Trafalgar there were neither
submarines, nor mines, nor aircraft, nor
15-inch guns to contend with? It would
seem incredible—if it were not true—that men
landing from the ships with the knowledge
that by almost superhuman courage and
endurance they had won the greatest naval
fight in the history of the world, were yet
greeted by the public with cold looks—in
some cases even with hisses—and by the
Press with a cynical pessimism which could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>only ask why they had not done <em class="upright">more</em>!—and
this, remember, at a moment when they were
on the rack of mourning for so many gallant
friends and comrades who had bought Victory
with their lives.</i></p>

<p><i>Well, it taught the Navy, if not a new,
certainly a very hard lesson: the lesson that
although "in the performance of plain duty
man mounts to his highest bliss," yet the
consciousness of duty done to the uttermost
must be its own reward. From the "man in
the street," the Service may in time win an
understanding gratitude and recognition, but
it seems that they are to be denied that instant
generous appreciation which would do so much
to atone for the tragic sense of personal loss
inseparable from even the grandest victory.</i></p>

<p><i>Shortly after the battle, one of the greatest
of their leaders wrote to a friend as follows:
"Our sacrifices were great, but they were
worth it.... Those who died, died gloriously,
in a spirit of great exaltation, and supremely
happy.... And, even if nothing else had
been gained, there is the knowledge that the
Old Sea Spirit still lives in the English Navy—an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>absolutely unconquerable Spirit, strongly
manifested on the 31st of May."</i></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>How <em class="upright">much</em> was gained we know to-day.
Lest I be betrayed to unbridled speech, such as
they would be the first to deplore and resent
... let me leave it at that.</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>OF VARIOUS INCIDENTS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> only damage affecting her fighting
efficiency which our ship sustained
in the Battle of Jutland was
the damage to her boat booms. This was
repaired within the week, and, had the
necessity arisen, we could have again gone
into action seven days after our return to
the northern base. But the Huns were far
too busy licking their wounds to trouble us
further at this time. Gradually and grudgingly
they were forced to admit the great
losses which they had at first so strenuously
denied and ignored. It was a dilatory and
undignified performance, by no means
redeemed by the "military reasons" (!)
which they adduced in excuse, and it
certainly did not tend to increase their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>prestige in the eyes of the watchful neutral
nations. There being, therefore, no immediate
need for our services, we remained in
harbour enduring with what grace we could
command the nerve-racking clamour set up
by the dockyard mateys as they meticulously
made good all our minor damages.</p>

<p>On the afternoon which saw their work
complete down to the last bolt and rivet,
we received the usual signals preparatory
to going to sea, and some time in the first
dog watch proceeded out of harbour.</p>

<p>The following day dawned calm and fine,
the visibility remaining good throughout
the day. At 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> we went to "Divisions"
on the upper deck, and were just about to
march forward to the quarter-deck for
prayers when H.M.S. —— on our port
beam opened fire with her secondary armament
on a Zeppelin which had suddenly
appeared from behind a small cloud. The
shells did not take effect, but the Zepp
turned tail and fled at top speed.</p>

<p>Immediately after prayers we went to
"Control Parties" for an hour in order to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>ready in case any more airships materialized.
However, nothing occurred and at about
10.30 the "Secure" was sounded. I went
on the bridge at 11 o'clock, as it was my
submarine lookout watch, and there heard
that the light cruiser ——, operating some
miles ahead of the Fleet, had hit a Zeppelin
which had subsequently disappeared over
the horizon, badly down by the nose, and
apparently about to descend to the water.
We were told to keep a sharp lookout, but
no sign of her was seen.</p>

<p>After lunch "General Quarters" was
sounded off and every one went to their
"action" stations.</p>

<p>Commodore "T." had reported some time
before that he was in touch with the enemy's
heavy forces.</p>

<p>The battle cruisers were now just in sight
on the horizon on our starboard bow, and
we rejoiced to think that this time they
would not be able, as at Jutland, to keep
nearly all the fun to themselves. We all
strained our eyes ahead for the first glimpse
of the "Hoch See Flotte," but the minutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>flew by and at 2.30 there was yet no sign
of them. Then a second communication
was received from Commodore "T." saying
that the enemy was flying at full speed
towards Heligoland, and at 3 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, as we
were getting among the Hun mine-fields,
we had to reluctantly abandon the chase
and turn for home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rumours of that "leave" to which we
were all so eagerly looking forward had
been flying about since the beginning of
August, but it was not until September 10
that the Flagship hoisted the signal for us
to raise steam. We weighed at 6.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>
and steamed out to sea, and the next
morning at 8.30 we dropped anchor in ——.
Getting under way again at noon we proceeded
into dock, and as soon as the caisson
had been floated into place and sunk, we
were free to go on "leave."</p>

<p>I caught the 3.30 dockyard train to
Edinburgh, and on arrival there fell in with
the Captain of Marines, the dentist, and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>of the <abbr title="Royal Naval Reserve Assistant Paymaster">R.N.R.A.P.</abbr>'s, and had dinner with
them at the North British Hotel; after
which I embarked on the 10.30 train for
London, where I arrived at 8 o'clock the
next morning.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>This was the first leave, other than "sick
leave" that he had had since leaving Dartmouth
on August 2, 1914, and it is not
surprising that he declared it to be the best
he had ever spent. Details would, however,
be of little interest to the reader, and so I will
only add that I had the great pleasure of
taking him down to my bank, and there
opening an account for him with the first
cheque received from the publishers on account
of "royalties" for "From Dartmouth to the
Dardanelles," which had appeared the previous
June. I remember I gave many fussy
maternal injunctions as to the necessity of
keeping "tally," and begged him not to
emulate the example of that naive lady who,
on receiving a courteous intimation from her
banker that her account was overdrawn,
replied indignantly that that was quite impossible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>because she still had several cheques
left in her cheque-book!</i></p></div>

<p>On Thursday, September 21, leave was
up, and in company with most of our
officers I travelled that night to Edinburgh,
arriving in that town at 7.30 the next
morning.</p>

<p>We changed into the special train for ——,
where our ship was in dock, and arrived
there at 10 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> We had considerable
trouble with our luggage as no vehicles
were available, and we had to lug our traps
along as best we could until we met a cart
proceeding in the required direction, the
driver of which—for a financial consideration—consented
to relieve us of our burdens.</p>

<p>On reaching the ship we found our quarters
still absolutely uninhabitable. Dockyard
hands were working all over the place, and
all gangways and flats were encumbered
with a mad medley of iron plates, stray
fittings, and the usual collection of filth
which a ship always manages to accumulate
in the course of a refit. After wandering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>forlornly about for an hour with nowhere
to go and nothing to do, we got leave
from the Commander to quit the ship
until 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> the following morning. Campbell
and I promptly made tracks for the
dockyard gates, where we had the luck to
pick up a taxi, which drove us to the
nearest station, and we returned to Edinburgh.
On arrival Campbell telephoned
to some of his relations who lived in Ayrshire,
and hearing that they were at home,
departed thither by the 1 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> train. About
half an hour later the rest of the gunroom
mess turned up with the information that
"leave" was granted until the morning of
Monday, the 25th.</p>

<p>This intelligence I wired to Campbell, and
then repaired to lunch at the North British
Hotel. After lunch, finding that I had run out
of cash, I bethought me of Messrs. Gieves,
naval outfitters, and ever-ready friend in
need to the stranded <abbr title="Naval Officer">N.O.</abbr>, and repairing
to their Edinburgh establishment explained
my dilemma, and requested them to cash
a cheque for me. This, with their unvarying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>courtesy, they promptly did, and with a
financial crisis thus happily averted, I
returned to the hotel for tea.</p>

<p>I was awfully bored at the thought that
I actually had two days of precious leave
on my hands and nowhere decent to spend
it, and I was wondering if in spite of the
expense it might not be worth while to go
south again, when I got a wire from Campbell
asking me to join him in Ayrshire,
which invite I joyfully accepted. But as
there was no train that night I had to defer
my departure until the next morning.</p>

<p>Campbell's relatives proved most kind
and hospitable, and after spending a very
pleasant week-end I returned with him to
the ship on the morning of the 25th.</p>

<p>We had hardly arrived before the Captain,
who was always great on sport and exercise,
ordered us all to go out hunting with some
local basset hounds. This order was received
with a regrettable lack of enthusiasm.
Still, an order is an order, and so at 12.30
I started out with two of the others.
Unfortunately we had omitted to ascertain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>the whereabouts of the meet, and when,
after walking several miles and making
many fruitless inquiries, we eventually
discovered the kennels, it was only to find
that hounds had gone and no one could
tell us their destination. Disconsolately
we wandered about for hours, but never a
sign of the hunt did we see.</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> we spotted three of our Snotties
in a motor-bus returning from their equally
unsuccessful search, and so we joined them
and went back to the ship. The only three
of our mess who succeeded in finding
hounds turned up very cross, footsore, and
weary at about 8 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, and accused us—most
unwarrantably—of shirking!</p>

<p>By 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> next morning we were out of
dock, and coaling started at 11.30 and
finished at 2 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>—not a very good average.
After coaling we found the bathroom in a
disgusting state—no lights, no water, no
steam. Eventually we managed to procure
a mere dribble of cold water with which
we had to remove the coal-dust from our
persons as best we could.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>After "General Quarters" next morning
a hideous rumour arose that we should be
required to go basseting again that afternoon,
but mercifully other affairs intervened,
and furthermore it began to rain, so to our
great relief basseting was declared off.</p>

<p>Most of the gunroom mess went to
Edinburgh again, but I stayed on board
and spent a quiet hour or so writing letters.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> January 15, 1917, we left the base
where we had spent Christmas and
proceeded northward again, but
nothing worthy of note occurred until
some six weeks later. Then one day we
were going to sea for manœuvres, and soon
after we had cleared the harbour some of
us Snotties at the time variously occupied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>in the gunroom were startled by blasts
from the siren.</p>

<p>We promptly rushed up on deck to find
the ship rapidly altering course to port;
at the same moment the forward 4-inch
guns fired a salvo, and we saw the shells fall
about 3000 yards away, just short of the
conning-tower of a U-boat awash on the
surface. Apparently until we fired she
had been unaware of our approach, for she
immediately submerged, and made no
attempt to fire a torpedo at us.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that submarine
warfare has become almost a commonplace
of naval existence, the knowledge of the
near presence of an invisible foe never
fails to produce a considerable thrill and a
tightening of the nerves, half hope and half
apprehension. This doubtless is intensified
in the case of those who have already been
through the unpleasing experience of having
their floating home sunk beneath their feet.
In addition to my own midnight adventure
in the Dardanelles on May 13, 1915, three
of the others in the gunroom had already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>undergone that ordeal when the <i>Hogue</i> was
torpedoed. However, this particular U-boat
must have been suffering from nerves,
for, so far as we know, she made no attempt
to attack us. Perhaps the near presence
of our watchful destroyers suggested to her
that it was a case for discretion rather
than for valour. Barring this incident
manœuvres on that occasion passed off
uneventfully.</p>

<p><i>I regret that this chapter cannot justify its
title. On mature consideration I have come
to the conclusion that to dilate further on the
very interesting subject of submarines would
be indiscreet.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A week or two later the Vice-Admiral
evolved a scheme for alleviating the monotony
of our lives, and requested the <abbr title="Commander in Chief">C.-in-C.</abbr>'s
permission to send each division of his
squadron over to the northern shore of the
anchorage for three day's complete rest
from routine and in order to provide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>officers and men with a chance of getting
ashore.</p>

<p>Permission having been duly granted
we anchored one evening, having previously
dispatched a working party consisting of
<abbr class="spell">A.B.</abbr>'s, carpenters, etc., to prepare a field
in which to hold some athletic sports.</p>

<p>The next day dawned fine and clear.
Owing to the flow of the Gulf Stream, the
temperature in these latitudes is much
warmer than dwellers in the south would
imagine, and in this month of April 1917
we were certainly much more fortunate
than our fellows in less northerly districts.</p>

<p>At 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> I landed in company with a
Lieutenant and two other Snotties, and we
decided to walk the eleven miles to the
nearest township in preference to watching
the sports. We reached our destination
shortly after midday, somewhat footsore
and weary from the unaccustomed exercise,
but with fine appetites for lunch, which we
had in a very decent little hotel much
frequented in piping times of peace by
ardent anglers. Later on we inspected the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>curious old distillery which is the chief
object of interest in the town. Then we did
some shopping, and started on our return
tramp at about 2.30. We got back at 5,
had an excellent tea at a farmhouse, and
returned on board our ship at 7.30, feeling
much the better for the change and exercise.</p>

<p>Next morning, to our great disgust, we
were detailed to exchange some ammunition,
which occupation took up all the forenoon
and robbed us of time which could have
been spent more pleasantly on the beach.
However, by 1.30 I was free and went
ashore with another Snotty. Close by
was a high hill which had long been a
painfully familiar landmark to us by reason
of range-finding exercises, carried out, with
the pole on its summit as object, while the
ship steamed round the land-locked anchorage
in endless monotonous circles. Up
this hill we climbed, passing on our way
little groups of officers or men lying about
on its lower slopes, and smoking and
chatting in the pale sunshine, the while
they luxuriated in the brief change from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>shipboard: only a very few of them
emulated our youthful energy and reached
the top, from which a splendid view of
our base and its surrounding islands was
obtained.</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore on, various fires
sprang up, resulting from the action of
careless smokers, and these spread so
rapidly that shortly after we got on board
again a call came for volunteers to extinguish
them, since it was feared that if
damage to the countryside resulted, future
"joy stunts" in that district would be
prohibited. There was no lack of recruits
forthcoming, for this was just such a job
as the "matloe's" soul loves, as it gives
him ample scope for the indulgence of his
twin passions of dressing-up and roaring
lusty and ribald choruses to popular tunes!
To the dreamy melody of "Keep the' Ome
Fires burning—I <em>don't</em> fink," the fire party
embarked in the picket-boat with launch
and cutter in tow, all chock-a-block with
men of diverse ratings. Their costumes
were varied and heterodox, and they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>all heavily armed with broomsticks, swabs,
etc., with which to combat the flames.
When we reached the pier the men fell in,
and Commander "T." who was in charge
divided them into three parties and detailed
one party to deal with each of the main
outbreaks.</p>

<p>The party officered by Wilson, Laurence,
and myself ran the first mile at breakneck
speed, but the pace flagged when we got
among the bogs at the bottom of the hill,
for here every few yards we floundered up
to our waists in mud and water. To our
disgusted disappointment, when we arrived
at our special objective it was only to find
that we had been forestalled by a party from
another ship and the fire was already out.</p>

<p>It was a weird scene: from all over the
hill-side different parties were signalling
with flash-lamps, and bursts of song came
from every quarter. On the summit a
group of men from H.M.S. —— were lustily
yodelling "Life in the Alps," and altogether
it was a fair old beano for the ships'
companies engaged.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<p>When all the fires had been adequately
"strafed," we returned on board, an uncommonly
dirty but very merry crew.</p>

<p>That night the gunroom was entertaining
some officers from one of our submarines
which happened to be alongside, and on our
entry we were met by a fog of tobacco
smoke you could have cut with a knife,
and a chorus of song which made up in
volume what it lacked in melody. Clamouring
for instant drinks, we joined the
throng, and only a few minutes later who
should blow in but Commander ——, no
less dirty and dishevelled than the rest of us.
Evidently he had found the staid decorum
of the wardroom little to his taste, and
with that sublime indifference to his "exalted
rank" which characterized him when
"off duty," he joined in our gunroom
"rag" with as much zest as the youngest
Snotty—to whom, notwithstanding his
decorations and three stripes, he was in
point of age not more than a dozen years
senior.</p>

<p>The uproar was at its height when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>ship's corporal came to report in reproachful
tones that "lock up" was long overdue,
and I shall not easily forget his face of
amazed dismay when he saw the Acting
Commander (the Commander was away
on leave) hobnobbing with the gunroom
in democratic disregard of overwhelming
seniority.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>OF EXAMINATIONS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">From</span> the view-point of the Grand Fleet
the summer of 1917 was uneventful,
but for me and for my contemporaries
in the gunroom, the months of June
and July held a peculiar and rather apprehensive
interest. Having completed just
on three years' service as Midshipmen, we
were faced with the ordeal of exams,
which must be passed before we could get
our stripe, i.e. be advanced to the rank of
Sub-Lieutenant.</p>

<p>In May we had one of our rare and brief
spells of "leave"—just ten days from the
ship—and on our return we suddenly realized
with dismay that a bare four weeks
remained to us in which to work up the
five essential subjects. These are gunnery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>torpedo work, navigation, seamanship, and
engineering—rather a formidable list. The
time for intensive preparation was further
curtailed by a three days' "rest cure" on
the northern shore, such as has been
described in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>We could not forgo this much-prized
opportunity for exercise and recreation, but
once it was over we settled down in grim
earnest to "swot" at the subjects referred
to, and thenceforward our highly technical
conversation and absorption in abstruse
problems became a source of unmitigated
boredom to those of our messmates whose
horizon, by reason of their shorter service,
was as yet unclouded by the prospect of
such an ordeal as loomed upon ours.</p>

<p>Now, in peace-time, in order to "ship
one's stripe" it is only necessary to pass
an oral examination in navigation, and an
oral and written examination in seamanship.
This accomplished, the newly fledged Acting
Sub. automatically retires to the "beach,"
where he passes through gunnery, navigation,
and torpedo schools undistracted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>any of the executive duties of shipboard life,
and able to concentrate his whole attention
on each subject in turn. How beautifully
simple! But in time of war it is a very
different proposition. A Midshipman having
served his full term in that rank must pass
both oral and written exams. in all five
subjects, and his hours of study may by
no means be allowed to interfere with
executive routine. In other words, he must
snatch them how and where he can.</p>

<p>Naturally this involves a considerable
strain, and much burning of midnight oil.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>It may also be noted that to a Snotty the
luxury of solitude and silence is unknown,
for he sleeps in a hammock in an echoing
steel-walled flat, has no cabin to retire to,
and his only study is the gunroom, which he
shares with some fifteen or twenty boisterous
"young gentlemen."... The gramophone
may be in full blast—stewards bustle about
with materials for meals—messengers hurry
back and forth—and in this uneasy atmosphere
he must learn to concentrate on the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span><i>highly difficult tasks before him. Well, it
must require, as our American Allies would
say, some concentration!</i></p></div>

<p>About the middle of June our Admiral
and his staff were transferred to other
scenes of activity, and to our great regret
the Admiral took in his train, as Flag
Lieutenant, L. F., best of Subs., who had
been our gunroom leader for two years.</p>

<p>On the day following this exodus—in a
dismal drizzle of rain—we were all lined
up on the quarter-deck awaiting the arrival
of our new Chief. Presently the barge was
seen approaching, and we congratulated
ourselves on the fact that the reception
ceremony would soon be over and we
would be able to return to the shelter of the
gunroom. But as the barge drew nearer
we saw that she was flying the "negative,"
which indicates that the Admiral is not
on board. This was unexpected, but the
comment passed round that in all probability
the crew of the boat had forgotten to ship
the "affirmative." Perhaps we should here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>mention that the "negative" is—in fact—a
flag used in the naval signal code, but in
the case of an Admiral's barge it consists of
a round painted disc having on one side
the same markings as the "affirmative,"
and on the other those of the "negative"
flag. This disc is shipped in a small
bracket on the foremost side of the funnel,
with the object of indicating to officers of
the watches, etc., that the Admiral is on
board, so that they may be prepared to
pay the proper marks of respect as he
passes the ships.</p>

<p>However, there was in this case no
forgetfulness on the part of the crew, for as
the barge drew alongside it proved to be
conveying only Admiral ——'s steward, in
charge of his luggage and furniture. These
safely deposited on board, the barge shoved
off again and departed ... presumably to
fetch the Admiral.</p>

<p>Still we waited. Still the rain drifted
down from leaden unsummer-like sky to
leaden unsummery sea.... Then a dingy
picket-boat was seen to be coming alongside.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>More furniture? More luggage? we queried
wearily.... But, no! To our infinite
astonishment, out stepped the Admiral
himself, unattended by Flag Lieutenant or
Secretary, and shaking hands with the
Captain he went forward to his quarters.</p>

<p>The Commander passed the word for all
officers to proceed to the Admiral's lobby,
and there we waited until one by one, in
order of seniority, we were called into his
cabin and presented. We juniors of course
came last, and on our return to the gunroom
there was much speculation as to what the
Admiral would do for a Secretary and Flag
Lieutenant. Presently the Captain sent for
C——, one of our mess, and to our amazement
he returned shortly afterwards with
the announcement that until the Flag
Lieutenant arrived he had been ordered to
perform the customary duties of that officer!
Realizing that he was somewhat deficient
in knowledge of the necessary routine,
C—— promptly sent for the Yeoman of
Signals and demanded instruction. Thereafter,
and during his tenure of office, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>gunroom was fairly littered with signal-pads,
signals, and confidential books; and he
was excused all other duties by the Snotties'
Nurse (i.e. the officer—usually the Navigator—told
off for the general supervision of
Midshipmen).</p>

<p>When on the following Sunday the
Admiral, on a tour of inspection, arrived
aboard the other ships, accompanied by a
Snotty, duly equipped with telescope and
signal pad, to act as Flag Lieutenant, the
surprise of the Captains and officers of the
division may be better imagined than
described!</p>

<p>C—— found his temporary promotion no
sinecure, for, among other duties, he had to
be continually on the alert to hear the pipe
which indicated that an officer of Captain's
rank or above it was coming over the
gangway, as it was his part to receive all
such visitors with proper ceremony and
conduct them to the Admiral's cabin.
However, in due course the genuine article
arrived in the person of Lieutenant X,
and C——, relieved of the onerous task,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>which he had really performed uncommonly
well, was once more relegated to the obscure
position of a mere Snotty.</p>

<p>And now the fateful moment for candidates
for promotion was imminent.</p>

<p>On the Sunday preceding the first ordeal
we decided to take a complete rest, for we
were feeling like a species of Strasburg
geese, owing to the enormous amount of
varied information with which we had
stuffed our brains during the preceding
month. A relief from the process of intensive
culture was clearly necessary if we
would rightly assimilate even a portion of
the stupendous mass of fact and theory we
had absorbed.</p>

<p>It was a splendid blue day, and in the
afternoon most of the members of the gunroom,
and the younger and cheerier people
from the wardroom, manned the pinnace,
and, equipped with various baskets of
provisions, set sail for a neighbouring island.
Once clear of the Fleet we hoisted the
Jolly Roger, and, after a little persuasion
from all hands, the <abbr title="Royal Naval Reserve">R.N.R.</abbr> Lieutenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>started on his long repertoire of sea songs,
in the choruses of which we all joined
lustily, if not tunefully.</p>

<p>On reaching the spot selected for landing
the anchor was let go, and we veered the
pinnace astern on her cable until we could
leap ashore. As soon as all the provisions
had been taken out, those of the party who
rather fancied themselves in a culinary
capacity retired to a sheltered corner, and
there set to work to build a fire as a preliminary
to the frying of "bangers" (sausages)
and the scrambling of eggs. The
rest of us flopped down on the heather at
the top of the cliffs and began to smoke and
talk. It was not long before some restless
person suggested bathing. "I say, what
about a bathe? Who's coming for a
swim?"</p>

<p>Some one else cautiously: "You go in
first and tell us what it is like."</p>

<p>"No! I'm d——d if I'll go in unless
some one comes with me."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go if you will." Then the
original proposer: "I don't know if it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>will be worth it. It's beastly cold, I'll
bet."</p>

<p>"There you are, backing out of it again!
I've a jolly good mind to lead the way
myself now." ... And so on, until at last
one brave spirit takes the plunge, and most
of the others follow suit.</p>

<p>The shirkers could not possibly resist
the temptation to indulge in some game at
the expense of their fellows, so they formed
themselves into a society for "the prevention
of bathers regaining their clothes"!
To this end they collected large piles of peat,
and no sooner did the unfortunate swimmers
appear, scrambling naked and shining over
the rocks, than they were greeted by a
spread salvo of dirt and earth! Casting
lurid reflections on the manners, characters,
and antecedents of their assailants, they
fled to cover. From above came the
challenge: "Out of your dugouts and over
the top, or we'll storm the Hindenburg
line!" and another salvo of peat burst in
and about the funk-holes, driving the
bathers once more into the open ...
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>Braving a withering fire they scaled the
cliffs, only to be promptly chased all over
the island in their birthday suits!</p>

<p>Fortunately there were no inhabitants
to be scandalized by this spectacle of
"British Naval Officers at Play!" The
amusement was only brought to an end by
cries of "Tea ready!" from the cooks.
Then the bathers were allowed to resume
their garments and soon all were doing full
justice to the good fare provided.</p>

<p>The menu consisted of sausages, scrambled
eggs, potted meats, tinned crab, sardines,
oranges, chocolate biscuits, and anything
else indigestible that you can think of....
After a brief interval allowed for assimilation,
trench warfare was instituted and a
furious combat raged up and down the
island until both sides were utterly exhausted.</p>

<p>At 6 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, pleasantly tired, and very
dirty, we all embarked, weighed anchor to
the strains of "Blow the Man down," and
still singing set sail for the ship, and drew
alongside to the tune of "When you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>come to the End of a Perfect Day," which
seemed to us singularly appropriate.</p>

<p>At 9 o'clock the next morning we embarked
in the picket-boat and proceeded to
H.M.S. ——, on which ship the seamanship
oral exam. was to be held. As soon as we
got aboard we were taken down to the school
place, and there told to wait until summoned.
The only seating accommodation
consisted of two hard wooden benches, and
some of the candidates from other ships
were already assembled, busily studying
seamanship manuals and signal-books:
they <em>looked</em> quite as dejected and apprehensive
as we <em>felt</em>!</p>

<p>Presently Captain ——, President of the
Examining Board, came in and summoned
the three seniors to his cabin. I was due
to go in with the next three, but it was
more than an hour and a half before we were
sent for, and as the minutes crawled by
we became more and more downcast and
miserable as we realized the enormous
number of questions the examiners must
be asking. At last our time came. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>were three officers on the Board, and I went
first to Commander ——. He questioned
me on the duties of officers of the watch in
harbour and at sea; and then passed on
to the handling of ships; boat work,
anchor work; ships' stores and construction.</p>

<p>Next I went to our own Commander,
who put to me queries about rigging and
more anchor work. Last—and worst of all—I
went to the Captain, who was examining
in signals. Luckily he did not himself
know very much about the subject, for
there is a lot of specializing in the Service,
and not even a Captain can be a specialist
in every branch of naval work, so he used
a printed list of questions and answers
made out by the Yeoman of Signals.</p>

<p>Then, however, he played us a nasty
trick, for he had the Chief Yeoman of Signals
down to his cabin to give us Morse and
semaphore exercises, and remained watching
us all the time instead of, as is usually done,
sending us up to the bridge. Of course,
in the latter case, if the Chief Yeoman is at
all a decent sort, he does the exercises very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>slowly, and if you wish him to do so
repeats any one you may miss. I did not
get a single word in Morse—and precious
little in semaphore—and I went down to
the gunroom ready to bet any money that
I had failed.</p>

<p>The Sub. of H.M.S. ——'s gunroom was
one of those giddy pessimists who always
predict disaster: "Expect you'll all be
Snotties for another month," was his
cheerful verdict! However, he gave us an
excellent lunch, and at 12.30 the boat
arrived to take us back to our own ship.
Three of our number were still on the rack,
so we went back without them.</p>

<p>Like myself, G—— and C—— were
gloomily certain that they had failed, and
we fairly dreaded the arrival of the boat
which would bring the Commander, our
two remaining candidates, and—the result
of the examinations. They did not arrive
until 2.30, and then, to my infinite relief,
I found that all but one of us had
passed, and—glory be!—that one wasn't
me!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Note by a captious mother: From which
remark we may safely assume that grammar
was not included in the examinations!</i>)</p></div>

<p>So far, so good—but the end was not
yet.</p>

<p>On the following day the navigation oral
was due, and as this did not take place until
the afternoon, we spent the whole morning
poring over navigation manuals. But we
might just as well have spared ourselves
the trouble, for you can't get a quart into
a pint pot, and we had already absorbed all
the knowledge on this subject that our
brains seemed capable of holding.</p>

<p>When we arrived on board the ship where
this particular exam. was being held we
found that candidates from other ships
were still in the throes and so we had to
wait. But this was all to the good, for in
the brief pauses between their interviews
we were able to glean from them some
valuable tips as to what kind of question
to expect.</p>

<p>When at last our turn came I was sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>first to the officer who was examining in
chart work. He handed me a chit on which
was set out a problem dealing with the
finding of a ship's position when in sight
of land, and left me to tackle it while he
questioned another candidate on chart
markings, etc. The problem was as follows:
To find the noon position of an imaginary
ship, somewhere in the Channel, her true
course being (so far as I can remember)
<abbr title="South">S.</abbr> 70° <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> From the ship in question the
bearing of Dungeness Light-Vessel at 10.30
was <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> 10° <abbr title="East">E.</abbr>, and of Owers Lightship at
11.15, <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> 35° <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> true. The deviation of the
ship's compass was 9° <abbr title="East">E.</abbr>, and the tide was
setting <abbr title="South">S.</abbr> 75° <abbr title="West">W.</abbr> true.</p>

<p>Having worked it out as I thought
correctly, I asked Commander —— to look
at it. He did so; and then asked me to
demonstrate the steps I had taken to obtain
my result. Then I at once perceived that
in laying off the course I had applied the
variation the wrong way, and consequently
my explanation took this rather ludicrous
form: "Well, sir ... I laid off the course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>here.... Oh no!... I see that's wrong
... it should have been here.... Then
I transferred to ... Oh no! That's wrong
again.... I cut the wrong line....
Then I laid off the tide to this point ...
but I see that I should have laid it off to
that...." And so on, correcting myself
all along the line. However, by these
peculiar methods I apparently satisfied him
that my knowledge of the subject, if badly
expressed, was sufficiently sound, and he
eventually passed me.</p>

<p>My next examiner was one of those
splendid people who somehow contrive to
put a question in such a way as to closely
suggest, if not actually to convey, the answer,
and so I got through without much difficulty.
In all we were examined in navigation
by five different officers, but met with
few real stumbling-blocks, and in pleasing
contrast to the previous day returned to
our ship in a very optimistic frame of
mind.</p>

<p>The whole of the succeeding day was
devoted to gunnery. In the forenoon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>turret and 4-inch-gun drill—at which I fear
we did not distinguish ourselves; but the
knowledge that the Snotties from another
ship, who were examined with us, had
done even worse, gave us some slight consolation.</p>

<p>In the afternoon came control, ammunition,
etc., and for these we had to repair on
board the ill-fated <i>Vanguard</i>, which, but
three days later, fell a victim to that
disastrous explosion which destroyed her
and so many of her gallant crew. The only
one of her officers on the Board was her
Gunnery Commander, who, I am glad to say,
was among those who were saved. Thanks
to him, this examination, although commonly
held to be one of the most trying,
was rendered comparatively easy, for he
was one of those officers—alas, but too
rarely met with in the Service—who do not
believe in expecting too much from a Snotty,
and are inclined to judge him rather in the
kindly light of future promise than in that
of present performance.</p>

<p>Two more orals were still before us,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>namely, torpedo and engineering. The former
was held on board our own ship, and
the latter in that in which the seamanship
had taken place. Our Commander, "T.,"
was President of the Torpedo Board, and
doubtless his verdict was based on our
everyday work as he knew it, rather than
on the immediate result of the examination,
for he let us down lightly.</p>

<p>The engineering again was not very stiff,
for since it is obviously a subject for
specialization, only a fairly wide general
knowledge was required of us.</p>

<p>I will not enlarge further on a theme
which, although of such vital importance
to us Snotties, will probably be of little
interest to the general public. The written
exams. which succeeded the oral occupied
four days, and then there remained only to
await the results.</p>

<p>From various unofficial sources we soon
learned the names of those who had qualified
in four subjects—but the navigation was
still in doubt. Although I was fairly
confident of success in everything else, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>this subject I was very nervous, as we
already knew that in it four of us had failed,
and I greatly feared that I was included in
the number. In fact, I became so pessimistic
that I laid the odds against myself
to the tune of a sovereign, and further
promised a friend to stand him a bottle of
champagne in the event of my forebodings
being falsified. However, on July 31, the
official information reached the ship, and
to my intense relief I found I had lost my
bet.... Never did loser pay up more
willingly!</p>

<p>On August 2 the Captain sent for Campbell,
our senior Snotty, and after having a
final "strafe" at him in that capacity,
informed him that he and I had been
rated Acting Sub-Lieutenants. Five minutes
later Campbell burst into the gunroom
proudly sporting on his sleeves the newest
and brightest of gold stripes, and, on hearing
the joyful news, I promptly dashed off to my
chest to don the coat which I, too, had had
prepared in anticipation of this blissful
moment! Our jubilation was only marred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>by our sympathy with the disappointment
of our two messmates who had not
had our luck, and whose promotion was
in consequence deferred for another two
months.</p>

<small>OF SHADOW AND SUNSHINE</small></h2>

</div>



<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Although</span> the disaster to the <i>Vanguard</i>
took place when we were in
harbour, and the ill-fated ship was
lying only about four cables from us, I
personally was not a witness of her sad end,
for it took place about 11.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, at which
time I was asleep in my hammock, and—strange
as it may seem—I was not even
aroused by the noise of the explosion.
However, next morning one of my messmates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>gave me the following account of
what he had seen. He had been just about
to turn in when he heard the detonation, and
dashed up on to the fo'c'sle to see what had
happened. Flames were leaping up to an
incredible height, and the air was thick
with fragments of red-hot metal.</p>

<p>Climbing down on to the quarter-deck,
he observed that some of our ship's company
were lowering a whaler, but as there was no
officer in charge he jumped in, took the
tiller, and headed for the scene of the
disaster. No trace of the <i>Vanguard</i> was
to be seen, but where she had lain the sea
was ablaze with burning oil, and there
seemed but little hope of rescuing even such
of her crew as might have survived the
explosion. Although the flaming waters
were strewn with debris of every description,
they saw no single sign of humanity save
only the scorched and blackened corpse of
a stoker, which they lifted into the whaler
and later handed over to a trawler.</p>

<p>On an island, some half a mile away,
numerous fires had sprung up, started
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>apparently by fragments of burning cordite,
and such had been the force of the explosion
that a cutter, weighing over two tons,
had passed right between the masts of the
next ship in the line.</p>

<p>Our boat remained in the vicinity of the
disaster for some time, but could find no
survivors to pick up, and so they had sadly
to return to the ship.</p>

<p>When next morning I was awakened by
Campbell and told of the tragedy which had
taken place while I slept, I could hardly
believe it. Leaping out of my hammock,
I ran up on deck to see for myself....
Alas, it was too true, for where only last
night the <i>Vanguard</i> had lain, nothing
was now visible but a few patches of
oil floating on the calm surface of the
harbour.</p>

<p>Collecting my gear, I went down to the
bathroom, where I found five members of
her gunroom, who, having been at one of
the Fleet Theatre shows the night before,
had escaped the disaster, and had been sent
to us pending the holding of a court of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>inquiry. They were naturally the centre
of an excited crowd, who all seemed to
expect them to be able to give some information,
in spite of the fact that as they
were in another ship, and more than a mile
away at the time of the explosion, they had
both heard and seen rather less than
ourselves.</p>

<p>That afternoon they were sent off to an
auxiliary cruiser, where they were confronted
with the melancholy task of trying
to identify such portions of human bodies
as had been recovered along the foreshore
and floating in the sea. It is not to be
wondered at that they returned in the
evening in a very dismal and morbid
frame of mind.</p>

<p>During the day, parties from many of the
ships were detailed to search the neighbouring
islands for the log, ledger, and other
registers kept on board <abbr title="His Majesty's">H.M.</abbr>'s ships, as
these may sometimes afford a clue to the
cause of an accident, and in any case it is
obvious that such highly confidential documents
as wireless and signal books must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>not be allowed to fall into unauthorized
hands.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I saw piled on our
quarter-deck a quantity of salvage, among
which were an officer's overcoat, two seamen's
bags, an empty small arms ammunition
box, and some Service books; the latter were
so scorched and so covered with oil fuel as
to be practically undecipherable, as was
the case with nearly all papers recovered.
Divers were sent down to inspect the wreck,
of which, however, little remained to afford
a clue to the cause of the disaster. Of
masts and funnels there was no sign, and
only two turrets, minus roofs and guns,
were found at some distance from the
rest of the debris. It was discovered that
all magazines except one had blown up.</p>


<p class="mt2">There was universal rejoicing when some
two weeks after the tragic end of the luckless
<i>Vanguard</i>, and about a week after the
conclusion of exams., the whole Fleet moved
to another base. Here we were much more
in touch with civilization, for a large town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>with quite respectable shops was within
reach.</p>

<p>On the first opportunity I went ashore,
and, in wilful disregard of the proverb
which warns us not to count our chickens
before they are hatched, invested in a nice
new pair of gold stripes, and got the ship's
tailor to sew them on to the sleeves of one
of my coats, in hopeful anticipation that
I might shortly be entitled to wear them.
One day, before we had received the official
intimation of our promotion, Campbell and
I met another of our term who, having
already heard of his success, was duly
invested, so to speak. Evidently suffering
from swollen head, he greeted us with the
offensive remark: "Hallo! you <em>Snotties</em>!"
... But when we received the joyful news,
we too swaggered into town, feeling as
conscious of our arms as though we had
been newly vaccinated and taken well,
and hoping to encounter some of our less
fortunate fellows to whom we could pass on
that swanky greeting!... But no luck!</p>

<p>After the exams. we had become Super-Snotties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>and as such not required to do any
of an ordinary Midshipman's duties, but the
Commander would not put us on to watch-keeping
until we had actually "shipped our
stripes," so we had, in the graceful lingo of
the gunroom, absolutely "stink all" to do
for nearly three weeks, and could go ashore
every day if we pleased. Now, however,
this blissful period was at an end, and we
had to begin watch-keeping. After our
slack time we thought this dreadfully hard
work, although we only had to keep two
watches a day for two days running, and
then had three days off—and no night
watches at all! In reality this was, of
course, very light work, and I looked back
on it with rueful regret when some two
months later, for three solid weeks, most of
which were spent at sea, I had to be on the
bridge for twelve hours out of the twenty-four.</p>

<p>It had long been my cherished ambition
to be appointed to one of the smaller craft,
in which my work would be much more
varied and responsible than that of a junior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>officer in a big ship. So, shortly after
receiving promotion, I applied through the
Captain to have my name forwarded with
a view to being appointed to the <i>Vernon</i>
for the torpedo control course, which same
is the usual preliminary to work in a
destroyer.</p>

<p>On September 1 I duly received my
appointment, and I finally left H.M.S. ——
on the 5th.</p>

<p>I arrived in Portsmouth on the 9th, having
spent the previous four days on leave in
London. Some dozen other Subs. were
about to undergo the torpedo course, which
commenced on the following morning, and
we found that we were to be billeted at the
Central Hotel. We were all delighted at
the prospect of living on the "beach," for
we foresaw plenty of opportunity for going
to theatres, etc.</p>

<p>H.M.S. <i>Vernon</i> comprises three old wooden
hulks—relics of the days of Nelson—and
they are moored at the head of Portsmouth
Harbour, and connected bow to stern by
broad gangways. These ships collectively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>form the torpedo school of the Navy, and
nearly every <abbr title="Naval Officer">N.O.</abbr> at some period of his career
undergoes a course of instruction here.</p>

<p>When next morning we arrived on board
we had to traverse the whole length of the
three ships to reach the bows of the farthest,
where the torpedo control room is situated.
A fairly extensive knowledge of torpedoes is
necessary in order to pass for Sub-Lieutenant,
and so we already knew all about
a "mouldy" as they are called in naval
vernacular. However, this first forenoon,
a Chief Petty Officer was detailed to run
through the main essentials in order to
refresh our memories, but most of us,
relying on our recently acquired knowledge,
settled down in comfortable corners and
dozed until lunch-time. The course proper
commenced in the afternoon. Much to
our disgust, about 2 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> a signal was
received saying that all officers undergoing
torpedo control course were to be billeted
in the <i>Redoubtable</i>, a very old battleship,
moored at the northern end of the docks,
and used as a depot ship.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>At 3.20, work being over for the day, we
caught the 3.30 boat to the beach, and set
about transferring our gear to our new
temporary home. We were, however, much
relieved to find on inquiry that the <i>Redoubtable's</i>
last boat did not run until
11.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, so after all our liberty would
not be much curtailed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap mt2"><span class="smcap">The</span> course in the <i>Vernon</i> lasted for
one week, and when it was finished
we were free to go on leave till we
received our new appointments.</p>

<p>After about seven days' leave I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>appointed as second in command of H.M.S.
<i>P——</i>, based at Portsmouth, and arriving in
that town on the evening of October 1,
in accordance with instructions I reported
myself at the <abbr title="Royal Navy">R.N.</abbr> barracks.</p>

<p>It appeared that nothing was known there
as to the movements of ships, and I was
referred to the Commodore's office. There
I could glean little more information, but
was advised to go down to Boat House
Jetty, where <i>P——</i> was always berthed
when in harbour. However, at the moment
she was not there, so I returned to the
Commodore's office to ask where I could be
billeted for the night. They told me I could
get a bed at the Navigation School, and that
the first thing in the morning I should go
down to Captain "D.'s" office, as all patrol-boats
and destroyers being under his direct
orders, his secretary would be able to give
me definite information as to when my ship
was expected in. Accordingly at 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>
next morning I made my way to the said
office and reported. The <abbr title="Assistant Paymaster Royal Naval Reserve">A.P.R.N.R.</abbr>,
who was Captain "D.'s" secretary, informed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>me that <i>P——</i> was out, but would
probably be in that afternoon, and advised
me to return about 4 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> This I did—but
found I had missed her again, for though
she had come in at three o'clock she had
only stayed for half an hour.</p>

<p>That evening I got a note from the Sub.
of another boat saying that if I would come
aboard his ship at 11 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> next morning
I should there meet the First Lieutenant
of <i>P——</i>, whom I was relieving. I wondered
what on earth he could be doing on
another boat when his own was, I knew, at
sea, but on meeting him I learned that she
had unexpectedly received immediate sailing
orders while he was on short leave ashore
and had to leave without him. Having thus
missed her (at Devonport), he had hurried
round by train to Portsmouth—only to
miss her again!</p>

<p>I lunched on board with the two Subs.,
and afterwards went with M—— to the
pay office in barracks to draw a month's
pay which was due to the ship's company
of <i>P——</i>. When we returned, we found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>that she had come in, and was lying at a
buoy in mid-stream. We made a signal
for a boat, and shortly afterwards a skiff
arrived, with my new Skipper, Lieutenant
——, <abbr title="Royal Naval Reserve">R.N.R.</abbr>, in the stern-sheets. After
I had been introduced to him by the Sub.
I was relieving, he went off to Captain
"D.'s" office to get sailing orders and
confidential papers, and M—— and I
embarked in the skiff and proceeded to
<i>P——</i>.</p>

<p>I had left my gear on the "beach,"
intending to fetch it later, but very soon
the Captain returned with immediate sailing
orders, and I had to go off without it.</p>

<p>M—— and I kept the first watch on that
night, which looked like being quite a dirty
one.</p>

<p>The bridge was by no means water-tight,
and the spray that poured through every
crack and cranny penetrated also up our
sleeves and down our necks, so that we were
soon soaked to the skin. The ship rolled
so violently that presently the topmast
snapped off short and came down with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>crash on the chart-house, waking up the
Captain, who had been trying to get some
sleep. He at once came out on to the
bridge and took charge, while he ordered us
to go and see that the watch secured the
mast as well as possible and refixed the
wireless. This was no easy job in half a
gale, and with the boat rolling and pitching
to every point of the compass, but in the
end it was accomplished fairly satisfactorily—although,
with the broken mast sticking
out at an acute angle, the ship must have
presented rather a drunken appearance.
Then we returned to our post on the bridge,
and the Skipper was able to resume his
interrupted slumbers.</p>

<p>All went well until midnight, when we
were relieved by the Gunner, and went aft
to try and snatch some sleep before 4 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>
when we should again be required to go on
watch. Getting aft was a matter of some
difficulty, as waves were sweeping green
over the deck, and we had to cling tightly
to the life-lines to avoid being washed
overboard, and by the time we reached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>wardroom hatch we hadn't a dry stitch
on us. Even when we got below we had to
hang on for dear life to prevent ourselves
from being thrown violently from one
bulkhead to the other.</p>

<p>I did not get a wink of sleep that night,
for my whole attention was concentrated on
the frantic effort to remain in my bunk.
Boots and other articles slithered back and
forth on the deck in a slimy ooze of oil fuel
and sea water, and more than once I had
to jump out and rescue my clothes from
the mess. Pandemonium was loose! At
one moment the bath broke away from the
three hooks by which it was suspended
from the deck above, and landed with a
crash in the narrow space between the chest
of drawers and the bunk.</p>

<p>Altogether it was with positive relief
that I greeted the burly dripping figure in
oilskins and sea boots who came to call me
for the morning watch; and shoving on as
many clothes as I could over the pyjamas
I had borrowed from the Sub., I once more
made my way on to the bridge.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p>About an hour later the dawn broke
grey and dismal, and I could just distinguish
the faint line of the French coast....
Our mission accomplished, we set our helm
hard aport and proceeded to batter our
way back to Portsmouth with wind and sea
full in our faces.</p>

<p>At 8.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> the Gunner again relieved us,
and we went down to the wardroom in
search of breakfast. Here, amid a mad
medley of cutlery, crockery, and cruets,
we found a nasty-looking piece of cold bacon
skidding giddily over the table in company
with a loathly-looking loaf of bread. Presently
the steward appeared juggling with
two brimming cups of tea, and strenuously
endeavouring to keep his balance on the
swaying deck. With pardonable triumph
at having brought them from the pantry
without upsetting them, he placed the cups
on the table, where they added to the general
confusion by promptly slopping their contents
over everything.</p>

<p>In order to avoid being shot off our chairs
we had to hang on with one hand while we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>tried to feed ourselves with the other.
I had quite an exciting time trying to spear
pieces of bacon with a fork, my plate always
sliding away to the other side of the table
at the crucial moment! In the end I
became quite an expert at the job, and
managed to consume really a considerable
amount. (<i>N.B.</i> Try our new parlour-game:
"Pig-Sticking" on a destroyer in
mid-Channel!) Fortunately for me, I am
what is known as a "good sailor," and have
never yet experienced the miseries of seasickness.
What service in small craft must
mean for those with less tractable tummies
I shudder to think.</p>

<p>We sighted the Isle of Wight about 3 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>
and were congratulating ourselves on the
fact that within an hour and a half we should
be safely berthed in Portsmouth, and with
any luck would get a night in, as the ship
had been running exceptionally hard for a
week past.... But our congratulations
were premature, for when we drew near our
objective we received a signal ordering us
to anchor as convenient and await the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>arrival of another "P." boat which was
bringing us our sailing orders. This meant
that yet another night's work was before
us. So, having anchored in accordance
with instructions, we promptly turned in
to try and get some sleep before we had to
again proceed to sea.</p>

<p>Our sailing orders arrived about two
hours later, and their purport proved
particularly annoying for both M—— and
me, for it meant that he would be detained
on the ship for another thirty-six hours or so,
and for the like period I should still be
without my clothes, etc. It will be remembered
that I had had to come away
without my gear, which was still at Portsmouth.
However, we had to make the
best of it.</p>

<p>We got under way at about 8 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, did
our job, and after an uneventful trip
returned to our base, and finally secured
alongside Boat House Jetty at 10 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> on
a Sunday morning.</p>

<p>The other Sub. went off immediately to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>take up his new appointment, and I very
thankfully collected my belongings.</p>

<p>It was about 3.30 on that afternoon when
we learned that we were required to take
the place of a <abbr class="spell">T.B.</abbr> which had unexpectedly
been forced to dock, and in company with
another patrol-boat execute certain orders.
The <abbr class="spell">T.B.</abbr> we were replacing was down to
remain at the destination whither we were
bound over Monday, but as we were due
to commence our periodical boiler-cleaning
that morning, our Captain made a signal to
Captain "D." asking if we were to remain
at the place in question in accordance with
these sailing orders, or to return to Portsmouth
as per schedule. His reply was
that we were to return.</p>

<p>We left harbour at 4 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, and in a howling
gale dropped anchor at the spot indicated
in our instructions. Very soon we found
that one anchor would not hold—we had
already dragged about half a mile—and
I had to go up on to the fo'c'sle and superintend
the letting go of another....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>At 8 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> we weighed both and proceeded
to execute the duty required of us. I had
the first watch: there was a very heavy sea
running, and the wind being on our starboard
quarter, I had to take great care that the
ship did not get into the trough of the waves,
in which case she would not have answered
to her helm.</p>

<p>About 11.30 course was altered, bringing
wind and sea dead on our beam, and the
ship's head had to be continually brought
up to meet the waves.</p>

<p>However, nothing untoward occurred, and
at midnight I was relieved by the Gunner.
As on the previous night, the violent motion
effectually prevented me from sleeping,
and at 4 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> I had to go on watch again.
Then I found that we were already on our
homeward course.</p>

<p>The ship was steering very badly, and in
order to keep her on her course the port
engine had to be kept dead slow, which
greatly reduced our speed. When I had
been on the bridge for about half an hour
the steering-gear broke down altogether,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>which involved conning by engines alone.
With starboard going full ahead, and port
slow astern, she would hardly swing through
a degree. I sent for an <abbr class="spell">E.R.A.</abbr> (engine-room
artificer) to endeavour to repair the
steering-gear, and, through the voice-pipe,
informed the Captain, who was sleeping in
the chart-house, of the state of affairs.
Owing to the violence of the storm we were
making considerable leeway, and being
unable to keep within 20° of our course,
were carried some distance to eastward.</p>

<p>At dawn, the steering-gear having been
repaired, we were able to again make
headway in the right direction, and the
Captain now tried to work out our position
by dead reckoning. This was a very
difficult job, as there was no possible means
of ascertaining how far we had drifted from
our course. However, he proved himself a
highly skilled navigator, for, although the
land was completely obscured by heavy
rain squalls, at 11 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> we exactly hit off
the buoy which marks the entrance to the
Channel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>Owing to the fury of wind and waves we
had sustained considerable damage. The
stout iron stanchions supporting the engine-room
hatch were bent; the port foremost
Berthon boat had broken adrift from its
securing chains; several ventilators had
been unshipped, and every one of our
fenders had been swept overboard. But
by 1.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> we were safely secured alongside
Boat House Jetty, and one watch
proceeded on leave.</p>

<p>I had to remain in charge on board, but
dined with the Gunner of <i>P——</i>, which was
lying alongside. He was an old friend, as
he had been in charge of the cadets at
Dartmouth during the one term I spent
there.</p>

<p>A week later, the boiler-cleaning being
finished and the damage aforementioned
having been made good, we were once more
ready for sea, and in due course received
sailing orders....</p>

<p>We arrived at our first destination at
about 3 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> <abbr class="spell">T.B.</abbr> —— made fast astern
of us, and after I had seen her secured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>I turned in until 7.30, when we once more
got under way and proceeded into harbour.
Here we made fast alongside the ——,
which was nice and handy for getting
ashore. I was not greatly impressed with
—— as a town, but it afforded an opportunity
for some much-needed exercise.</p>

<p>At 5.30, in company with another "P."
boat we steamed out of harbour to find a stiff
breeze blowing, and the tide setting strongly
against the wind. This created a nasty
chop on the water, but, as the ship we had
to shepherd carried no signalman, in order
to facilitate communication with her in
reference to course to be steered, etc., we
decided to secure alongside her until 8 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>,
when she was due to get under way. When
we had made fast, <i>P——</i> secured alongside
us, thus bringing the full strain of two boats
on our hawsers. I heard our wire beginning
to strand, so gave the order to ease away
and take the strain on the grass line, but
that had no sooner tautened than it parted.
Directing the men to pay out the wire as
slowly as possible, I dispatched a messenger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>aft to the Captain to inform him that we
should not be able to hold on much longer.
Before he had time to give orders to let go
aft and get way on, the wire was all paid out
and we had to let the end go overboard,
as, had it parted, it would naturally have
flown back, and probably caused serious
injury to those on the fo'c'sle. The remaining
securing lines had then to be let go,
and thus we were left, drifting about the
roads with no way on, and still secured to
and bumping <i>P——</i>. After considerable
trouble we managed to get free and dropped
our anchor. By this time it was 7.30, so
we had only half an hour for dinner, after
which we weighed anchor again.</p>

<p>I had the first watch, during which no
incident occurred, and I turned in at
midnight. When I returned to the bridge
at 4 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> I found that the night was now
calm and clear, but it was very dark and
there was no moon. I took over from the
Gunner, who went below to turn in. All
went well for about twenty minutes. Then—suddenly—about
one point on our starboard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>bow, I saw all steaming lights of
another vessel switched on!</p>

<p>Now, by rule of the road at sea, as the
stranger was on our starboard hand, we
were bound to give way to her and pass
under her stern, so I gave the order,
"Hard aport." Unfortunately she was so
very close that there was no time to get full
helm on, and seeing that a collision was
inevitable I gave the order, "Stop both,"
and dashing to the starboard telegraph
myself put it to "Stop." Before I had
even let go of the handle there came a
mighty crash ... the ship quivered from
stem to stern and stopped dead.</p>

<p>The Captain was beside me in an instant.
"What are we doing?" he demanded ...
meaning what orders had I issued. I
replied, "All stopped, sir."</p>

<p>Then we looked over the canvas screen
and saw that the other boat had her bows
locked into our fo'c'sle, and had heeled over
to an acute angle as she struck. For the
moment we thought she must sink—but,
hailing her, the Captain requested her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>Commander to keep her bows locked in
until we had ascertained the extent of the
damage. It would appear, however, that
he did not hear the hail, for he promptly
went astern and backed out.</p>

<p>As the water rushed in through the rent
in our side we began to go down by the
bows, and for an anxious moment we
thought we were done for ... but by
good luck we still floated.</p>

<p>Leaving me to superintend the getting out
of the collision-mat, my Skipper signalled
to the ship that had rammed us—which, by
the way, was another "P." boat—asking if
we could give her any help. She replied in
the negative, saying that so far as she could
ascertain she was not damaged, and was
returning to her base.</p>

<p>After I had reported to the Captain that
the collision-mat was in place, he ordered
me to go below and superintend the shoring
up of the bulkheads. The stokers off
watch, and the watch below, under the
directions of the Engineer, had already
collected all spare balks of timber, mess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>stools, etc., for this purpose. The hatch
leading to the coxswain's storeroom had
been opened up and it was discovered that
we were making no water abaft the compartment
in which we had been holed.</p>

<p>When I had seen the bulkheads shored up
to my satisfaction, I reported to the Captain
on the bridge. Every possible precaution
for insuring the safety of the ship having
now been taken, he decided that it would be
best to get under way immediately, and
endeavour to get back to Portsmouth
without further delay, in case it came on
to blow and the sea got up. At the moment,
fortunately for us, it was quite calm. Not
feeling certain that the bulkheads would
withstand the strain of going ahead, and
not knowing the extent of the damage the
ship had sustained below the water-line,
the Captain decided to proceed stern first
until daylight enabled us to make a more
thorough examination.</p>

<p>We had been struck a bare six feet forward
of the stoker's mess deck, the foremost
living-space in this class of ship, in view of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>which fact we were uncommonly lucky in
that no lives were lost, nor had any of the
crew been injured.</p>

<p>We were obliged to proceed dead slow
as, owing to her overhanging counter, the
slightest sea jarred the ship horribly, and
stern first at this speed she steered very
badly. It was only with the greatest
difficulty that I was able to keep her
within five degrees of the course without
having to supplement the helm by
continually altering the revolutions of the
engines.</p>

<p>When daylight came, I went with the
Captain on to the fo'c'sle, and then we
discovered that the collision-mat was quite
inadequate—in fact it had already carried
away and was towing aimlessly alongside.
I ventured to suggest to the Skipper that it
might be a good plan to fill up the hole with
fenders, to which he agreed, and leaving me
to summon the watch and get the job duly
executed, he returned to the bridge to give
the necessary orders for bringing the ship
round, as he considered that it was now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>safe to proceed in the orthodox manner—bows
first.</p>

<p>Having seen the work on the fo'c'sle
accomplished, I once more resumed my
morning watch, and after the Captain had
given orders for a stoker to be posted on
the mess deck, with instructions to give
immediate warning in the event of the
bulkhead showing any signs of giving, he
retired below.</p>

<p>About 7.30, as everything seemed to be
holding well, I ventured to increase speed
to 10 knots. At 8 I was relieved by the
Gunner and went down to breakfast;
after which, at the request of the Captain,
I made out a rough report of the orders
I had given in respect of helm and engines
in the moments immediately preceding the
collision. This, after revision, would be
embodied in the statement he would have
to forward to Captain "D." as soon as we
reached harbour. We had already dispatched
a wireless message to the effect
that we had been in collision and were
returning to our base.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>Finally, at about 3 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> we entered harbour
and secured at our usual berth.</p>

<p>I was in a bit of a funk that I should
have to appear before a court of inquiry.
However, it must be assumed that on the
report sent in by my Skipper and the
Commander of the ship with which we had
had the misfortune to collide, the <abbr title="Commander in Chief">C.-in-C.</abbr>
was satisfied that everything possible had
been done: that in the circumstances the
collision could not have been avoided, and
that no blame attached to the officers on
watch at the time.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, since accidents must be
sternly discouraged, the Captains were
admonished, and warned that a still stricter
lookout must be kept in future.... This
was very rough on them, as naturally every
precaution is taken to keep as keen a lookout
as possible, not only with a view to
avoiding disaster, but also in hope of
locating and perhaps, with luck, strafing a
U-boat.</p>

<p>The responsibilities of a Commanding
Officer must needs weigh heavily, for it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>obvious that the High Command can take
no cognizance of that occult and fickle
factor "luck," and naval discipline in
war-time must be merciless.</p>

<p>Little wonder that the <abbr title="Naval Officer">N.O.</abbr> is inclined
to be superstitious, and to burn incense at
the shrine of Joss!</p>

<p>A week later, my ship being in dock,
I was able to go home on two weeks' leave.
Oh, most certainly collisions are severely
to be deprecated!... But—the cloud had
a silver lining!</p>

about the hospital life in other wars.... The art of this
book seems to me to be greater than any of these, in that
